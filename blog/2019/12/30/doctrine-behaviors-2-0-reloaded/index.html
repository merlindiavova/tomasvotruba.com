            <h2 id="from-first-excitement-rush-to-heavy-burden-of-responsibility">From First Excitement Rush to Heavy Burden of Responsibility</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors">KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors</a> development was stuck since 2015. There were 10+ opened PRs to use interfaces over traits (to give classes clear contract), bug-fix PRs, and design improvements.</p>
<p>When I got a message from KnpLabs with an offer to maintain, I was super happy to say <a href="https://sivers.org/hellyeah">&quot;hell, yeah&quot;</a>. An excitement rush went through my veins. I could saw all the huge refactoring for better and how it helps the whole PHP community to move another step forward.</p>
<p>A moment later, when I realized what happened and how quickly, I started to be scared. The repository looked like a massive chunk of code that will need many design changes,  back compatibility breaks, etc. <strong>All the responsibility started to fall on my shoulders, and it was heavy</strong>.</p>
<p>I took it as challenge and started to <a href="/blog/2018/04/30/programming-climbing-a-huge-mountain/">climb mountain</a>, without knowing if or how this will end-up.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    There were only 2 options:<br>finished tagged version 2 or burn-out in the process.

<p>I took the risk.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-new-in-doctrine-behaviors-2.0?">What is new in Doctrine Behaviors 2.0?</h2>
<p>All right, you get it. There were lots changes, but what exactly?</p>
<p>Let's start with the <em>sad part</em>.</p>
<h3 id="3-removed-behaviors">3 Removed Behaviors</h3>
<p>Tests did not cover some behaviors, nor described in README. When you look at them closely and write a test for them, you'll see <strong>they never worked</strong> or worked accidentally. I've cross-references these features with <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/gedmo/doctrine-extensions">gedmo/doctrine-extensions</a> and saw DoctrineBehaviors is the only package that has them, resp. pretend to have them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Saying that these 3 behaviors were dropped:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/473">Sortable</a></p>
<ul>
<li>it only updated all values to <code>1</code>, completely broken</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/467">Geocodable</a></p>
<ul>
<li>it only worked on PostgreSQL with a specific function</li>
<li>has a conflict with km/miles</li>
<li>method API was very limited to a few narrow cases</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/463">Filterable</a></p>
<ul>
<li>overcomplicated API 4 required methods for single simple filter</li>
<li>basically <code>findBy*()</code> magic on steroids, better use explicit non-magic methods with clear naming</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It is recommended to implement them yourself that suite your specific needs</strong>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now that the sad part is behind us let's look at new features.</p>
<h3 id="from-trait-to-interface">From Trait to Interface</h3>
<p>This work was initiated <strong>by <a href="https://github.com/bocharsky-bw">bocharsky-bw</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lemoinem">@lemoinem</a></strong> back in 2016. Thank you both for clear PRs, it was quite easy for me to see changes and apply them to new and drastically different code <a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/442">in this single PR</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The idea is simple</strong>: instead of traits that are problematic to detect by <code>instanceof</code> or <code>is_a()</code>, use interface for method and class contract.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What does it mean? This is <em>trait-first</em> approach:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Knp\DoctrineBehaviors\Model\Timestampable\TimestampableTrait;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class Product
{
    use TimestampableTrait;
}</code></pre>
<p>You use traits, so you don't have to create properties (<code>$createdBy</code> and <code>$updatedBy</code> in this case) manually. There are also 2 split traits for methods and properties, so the code above equals:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Knp\DoctrineBehaviors\Model\Timestampable\TimestampablePropertiesTrait;
use Knp\DoctrineBehaviors\Model\Timestampable\TimestampableMethodsTrait;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class Product
{
    use TimestampablePropertiesTrait;
    use TimestampableMethodsTrait;
}</code></pre>
<p>But what happens if you remove trait and want to override methods?</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class Product
{
}</code></pre>
<p>Well, there is no contract by an interface, so we have no idea to fix this, we introduced interfaces:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Knp\DoctrineBehaviors\Contract\Entity\TimestampableInterface;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class Product implements TimestampableInterface
{
}</code></pre>
<p>Now PHPStorm tells you what methods it needs. You can use your code or a trait to cover them.</p>
<p>It also easy to detect an object that uses this behavior, which significantly improved performance and architecture at the same time:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">use Knp\DoctrineBehaviors\Contract\Entity\TimestampableInterface;

// object
$isTimestampableEntity = $entity instanceof TimestampableInterface;

// string class name
$isTimestampableEntity = is_a($entityClass, TimestampableInterface::class, true);</code></pre>
<h3 id="translation-now-needs-id">Translation now needs Id</h3>
<p>All the behaviors didn't add any id properties. Except for translation, where the id was added with this ugly magic method (mind the <code>@deprecated</code> note):</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/doc_beha_id_magic.png" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/issues/154">inconsistency</a> <a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/issues/415">was</a> <a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/158">problematic</a>. In short: it was buggy and hard to use your id property because DoctrineBehaviors tried to <em>guess</em> what id you probably want.</p>
<p>The fix was suggested <a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/421">early 2019</a>, but the final fix was <a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/480/files">merged in 2020</a>.</p>
<p>What does it mean for your entities? <strong>You need to add their own id</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff"> &lt;?php

 namespace App\Entity;

 use Knp\DoctrineBehaviors\Contract\Entity\TranslatableInterface;
 use Knp\DoctrineBehaviors\Model\Translatable\TranslatableTrait;

 /**
  * @ORM\Entity
  */
 class TranslatableEntityTranslation implements TranslationInterface
 {
     use TranslationTrait;

+    /**
+     * @ORM\Id
+     * @ORM\Column(type="integer")
+     * @ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy="AUTO")
+     * @var int
+     */
+    private $id;</code></pre>
<h3 id="scalar-types">Scalar Types</h3>
<p>Scalar types make bugs more comfortable to discover, e.g., when a subscriber is broken, and it does not add value, return null will result in a fatal error.</p>
<p>That's why all the traits have scalar param and return types:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff"> trait TimestampableMethodsTrait
 {
-    /**
-     * @return DateTimeInterface
-     */
-    public function getCreatedAt()
+    public function getCreatedAt(): DateTimeInterface
     {
         return $this-&gt;createdAt;
     }
 }</code></pre>
<p>Migration path for these types will be provided based on feedback, so <strong>in case you override these methods manually, you won't have to complete the types</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="code-quality-changes">Code Quality Changes</h3>
<p>Feature improvements are essential. But to make them fast and stable, the <a href="/blog/2019/12/23/5-things-i-improve-when-i-get-to-new-repository/"><strong>code quality has the same importance</strong></a>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    Energy saved on manual maintenance<br>
    can be used to improve features.
</blockquote>
<p>How has been code quality improved?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/435/files">ECS was added with PSR-12 coding standard check</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/470"><code>CHANGELOG.md</code> is fully generated</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/commit/3b17cdf656b5f904c4222c559d78bbd17217881a">tests now respect PSR-4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/445">Rector CI now checks dead code, code quality and Nette\Utils</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/436">PHPStan now checks the static analysis</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="community-driven">Community Driven</h2>
<p>Without the PHP community, packages are just chunks of code. Community around the package, city, or a meetup group is what makes it specials, gives it power and motivation to grow.</p>
<p><strong>I'd love to thank <a href="https://github.com/laurentHCM">@laurentHCM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nicolashachet">@nicolashachet</a></strong> for the testing process of version 2 and instant migration with Rector. For their patience to report issues, test new Rector rules, and trying to solve all the packages conflicts desperately.</p>
<p>You gave me <strong>the motivation</strong> that helped me to overcome difficult moments when I got lost in the code.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-migrate-from-version-1-to-2?">How to Migrate From version 1 to 2?</h2>
<p>What is the biggest problem of any significant refactoring? The backward compatibility (<em>BC</em>) breaks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class rename?</li>
<li>Trait renamed?</li>
<li>Return type added?</li>
<li>Param type added?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Roughly over 80-120 BC breaking changes</strong> were performed between versions 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Imagine you have 20 such entities in your code, using 4 behavior traits, and now you have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>complete interfaces</li>
<li>complete param types</li>
<li>complete return types</li>
<li>rename traits</li>
<li>add an id to every translation entity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> I'd be angry at any project, who would do such change, without providing one-click upgrade path</strong>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That's why during such BC breaking changes <strong>I've prepared <a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/blob/master/upgrade/rector/doctrine-behaviors-20.yaml">instant upgrade Rector set</a> you can run on your code</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">composer require rector/rector --dev
vendor/bin/rector process src --config vendor/rector/rector/config/set/doctrine-behaviors-20.php</code></pre>
<p>Single command turns to upgrade from 1 to 2 from days to few dozens of minutes.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-compare-to-gedmo/stof?">How does it Compare to Gedmo/Stof?</h2>
<p>Are you a stof/gedmo user? Then you're familiar <a href="https://github.com/stof/StofDoctrineExtensionsBundle/issues">with Symfony 5 issues</a> around it. Don't worry. The KnpLabs\DoctrineBehaviors 2 was developed bearing you in mind.</p>
<p>KnpLabs\DoctrineBehaviors don't support softdeletable and non-materialized tree path <em>yet</em>, but the rest of the features are covered.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-you-migrate-from-gedmo/stof-to-knp-labs\doctrine-behaviors?">How do you Migrate from Gedmo/Stof to KnpLabs\DoctrineBehaviors?</h3>
<p>Read <a href="/blog/2020/01/06/migrate-gedmo-to-knplabs/">Migrate Gedmo to KnpLabs</a> post to find the answer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That's all for me. Use it, bend it, break it, and report issues or pull-request so that we can make migration path together even smoother.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>I wish you happy new year 2020 full of huge adventures not only in code!</strong></p>
