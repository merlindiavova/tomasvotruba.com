<strong>How much did it cost? What was the effect? Was it worth it?</strong> I'll share answers to these question so you know what to expect when you start a similar project. Let's get numberz!</p>

            <p>When I bought the <code>gophp71.org</code> domain, I had no idea what it will become. You know, try to tell the whole PHP open-source community what min version should they use in <code>composer.json</code>, right? Explain why it's a good idea to work as a community to people you've never met. <strong>But when I saw <a href="https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/go-php-5-go">Go PHP 5</a> I felt it's my duty to give back to PHP community and help with PHP 7.1.</strong></p>
<p>Today it's gonna about numbers, how well PHP community works together and few of mine fuck-ups :)</p>
<h2 id="How-Much-Did-it-Cost">How Much Did it Cost?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Domain <code>gophp71.org</code>? - 15 $ per year, 2 years = <strong>30 $</strong> in total</li>
<li>Hosting? <strong>0 $</strong> Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tomasVotruba/gophp71.org">Github Pages hosting</a> and <a href="https://www.statie.org">static site generator Statie</a></li>
<li>And the work? I didn't Toggle it, but with all the design iterations, posts and commenting all over the internet <strong>I'd say ~25-30 hours</strong>. As you can guess, I'm very bad at tuning CSS for mobiles. Use your own hourly rate to have the idea in $.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What-was-The-Impact">What was The Impact?</h2>
<p>I took a while. Thanks to Jordi (thank you!), we have numbers on min. required PHP version on Packagist:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://seld.be/notes/php-versions-stats-2017-1-edition">May 2017</a> - 1,7 %</li>
<li><a href="https://seld.be/notes/php-versions-stats-2017-2-edition">November 2017</a> - 5,3 % (+ 218 % compared to previous 6 months)</li>
<li><a href="https://seld.be/notes/php-versions-stats-2018-1-edition">May 2018</a> - 11,8 % (+ 121 %)</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.packagist.com/php-versions-stats-2018-2-edition">November 2018</a> - 19,4 % (+ 64 %)</li>
</ul>
<p>Is 19,4 % to small for you?</p>
<p><strong>What about 38 528?</strong> That's the absolute number of packages that required PHP 7.1 in <a href="https://packagist.org/statistics">November 2018</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I look forward to May 2019 stats update coming anytime soon.</p>
<h2 id="Correlation-Causality">Correlation !== Causality</h2>
<p>I don't think one website changed the PHP world. We made it together as one community. I tried to convince <em>David</em> from PHP 7.0 to PHP 7.1 over lunch. I thought I lost him not having enough arguments and <em>Nette</em> will go with PHP 7.0. <strong>Later that month Nette went 7.1</strong> as one of the first PHP frameworks - it was not stable, but still had a big effect on Czech open-source maintainers üëç</p>
<p>There was a sparkle of hope this might work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Fabien from Symfony helped</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/fabpot/status/851558576770252800">by opening a pool on Twitter</a>:</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2019/go-php-die/symfony_pool.png">
<p>Over 1000 people helped this in that pool! To sum it up - 1003 specific people so far üëç</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Doctrine team also helped</strong> with <a href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/2017/07/25/php-7.1-requirement-and-composer.html">PHP 7.1 announcement</a> for all their packages. They also explained very nicely <em>Why dropping PHP support in a minor version is not a BC break</em> üëç</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote mb-5 mt-5">
"A BC break happens when there is an incompatible change that your package manager can't handle. For example, changing a method signature in a minor version is a no-go, since the composer version constraints mentioned above assume any minor upgrade can safely be used."
</blockquote>
<p>Remember this quote, we'll need it when we'll go PHP 8.1 (maybe?) later.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/TomasVotruba/gophp71.org/graphs/contributors"><strong>Over 19 PHP projects</strong></a> have added their go PHP 7.1 statement to the website in the 1st year. Thank you' all! üëç</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2019/go-php-die/most_active.png" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>Last but not the least, <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/6xqa23/go_php_71">the_alias_of_andrea</a> helped</strong> spread the news on Reddit üëç</p>

<p>&quot;Sure Tom, good job... you're the best, but we're really reading just for your fuck-ups.&quot;</p>
<p>All right...</p>
<h2 id="What-I-Fucked-Up">What I Fucked Up?</h2>
<h3 id="Too-Complicated-Wording">Too Complicated Wording</h3>
<p>I wrote &quot;add your project too&quot; instructions on the website, so all projects could join. <strong>I learned that people don't understand my complicated thoughts</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of keeping it as simple as:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Add your project if you require PHP 7.1 in the stable release&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>I created a mess like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Add your project if you have PHP 7.1 in the <code>composer.json</code> file. It doesn't matter it's not stable yet. If it's not stable yet, add <em>released: no</em> to the configuration file. But remember to update this website, when you finally decide to use a stable tag. Also, add some link to the statement, so we can read about it a bit more. I hope it's not too much to ask you to follow these very few simple steps. I really tried to make them very easy, as you can see. Thank you&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>That led to hanged PRs, manual <em>yes/no</em> corrections that didn't have much-added value and confused comments from contributors (I'm sorry about that).</p>
<h3 id="Too-Late">Too Late</h3>
<p><strong>I fucked up timing.</strong> PHP 7.1 was released in December 2016, yet <code>gophp71.org</code> was not launched until 7 months later.
I had the idea before, but <strong>I was afraid how will you react</strong>. I had thoughts like &quot;Who the hell is this Votruba and why does he think he is that he tells us what PHP version should we use?&quot; or &quot;Do you want us to go PHP 7.1? Well, we'll go PHP 7.0 on one project and PHP 7.2 on the other, a-ha!&quot; or &quot;What is he selling us? That's some version conspiracy!&quot;</p>
<p>Now I see that was stupid. I should start earlier, try it, give a go and adapt upon the feedback.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That's all folks, hope you enjoyed it! I sure did start almost 24 months ago with just this:</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/go-php-71/first-version.png">
<h2 id="What-s-Going-to-be-Next">What's Going to be Next?</h2>
<p>Will we &quot;Go PHP 8&quot;? Someone from Arizona, US <a href="https://gophp8.org">already bought the <code>gophp8.org</code> domain</a>.
Or 8.1, when 8 becomes more mature?</p>
<p>Who knows. All I know <strong>I'm very happy to be part of our PHP <del>community</del> family ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è, where we support each other despite our differences and work together when we need to</strong>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
