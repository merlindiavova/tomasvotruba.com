            <p>Do you know <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">Awesome lists</a>? If not, go to check them. They collect best sources about a certain topic. When I try to learn something new, I usually start on Github looking for &quot;awesome <technology>&quot;. I recommend at least briefly to check them.</p>
<p>The idea behind Awesome list is to have resources that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>are up-to-date with modern technologies</strong></li>
<li><strong>are the best in the field</strong></li>
<li><strong>are easy to learn by beginners</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="How-and-quot-Awesome-Doctrine-and-quot-was-Born">How &quot;Awesome Doctrine&quot; was Born</h2>
<p>When I was working with Nette, I met <strong>Doctrine ORM</strong> thanks to <a href="https://filip-prochazka.com">Filip Procházka</a> and his great <a href="https://github.com/Kdyby">Kdyby</a> open-source boom.</p>
<p>One day I decided to learn more about Doctrine. Documentation looked like a manual for experts rather than something I could learn from. I was also curious <strong>how people use Doctrine in real applications, how to overcome performance issues, some cool features and pro tips</strong>.</p>
<p>I was already familiar with <a href="https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php">Awesome PHP</a> by <a href="https://github.com/ziadoz">ziadoz</a>, so I looked for &quot;Awesome Doctrine&quot;.</p>
<p>0 results. Really? Why nobody made this? It's so obvious this would be useful.</p>
<p>Ah, it's my job then. And the joyful hell started.</p>
<h3 id="Many-Sources-on-Many-Versions">Many Sources on Many Versions</h3>
<p>I was lucky to find many articles about Doctrine. One about Filters, others about Events or Criteria. But when I tried to use the code, it often didn't work. After digging I found out there was version 1.0, which was completely different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: When you write a post about software, mention the version you're referring to – even if it only has one at the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I liked the concept in article and wanted to use it, but I didn't know what is different in version 2.4. I closed it.</p>
<p>I also read <a href="https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/doctrine-2-uvod-do-systemu">Czech series on Zdroják</a> written by <a href="https://www.jantichy.cz">Jan Tichy</a>. It could give me great insights, but it was about Doctrine 2-beta. I closed it.</p>
<h3 id="What-to-put-in-the-list">What to put in the list?</h3>
<p>I've decided to focus on sources released in that year. When articles and Doctrine version are the same - Doctrine 2.4 - it will be great source to learn from.</p>
<p>Idea was good, <a href="https://github.com/biberlabs/awesome-doctrine">List</a> was done. I was happy until...</p>
<h3 id="Doctrine-2-5-was-out">...Doctrine 2.5 was out!</h3>
<p>So now each of the 20 sources on the list got a bit deprecated.</p>
<p>Oh, so that's why nobody made it in the first place :).</p>
<p>Now I also understand why many programmers hate new versions of software and want to stick with version they already know. It makes sense in such conditions.</p>
<h2 id="and-quot-Awesome-Symfony-and-quot">&quot;Awesome Symfony&quot;</h2>
<p>Before I realized it makes no sense to make a list of sources, because next year I could drop most of them, I make <a href="https://github.com/Pehapkari/awesome-symfony-education">Awesome list for Symfony</a>.</p>
<p>New Symfony version is released every single year, so the list is even more outdated than Doctrine.</p>
<p><strong>So what this leads to?</strong></p>
<h2 id="Running-in-Circles">Running in Circles</h2>
<p>If I get back to the <strong>useful source</strong> idea from the beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>are up-to-date with modern technology</strong></li>
<li><strong>are the best in the field</strong></li>
<li><strong>are easy to learn by beginners</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To make this happen, I would have to create &quot;Awesome * List&quot; every year.
To make that happen, each article would have to be checked for compatibility with each new version and updated if needed.</p>
<p>That would mean around 50 articles on Doctrine every year. <strong>And all this work just to keep status quo</strong>. In big communities like Symfony and Laravel, this happens, but I still consider it too much wasted work (constructive ideas coming bellow).</p>
<p>So sources are useful upon their release but become more and more outdated every year. Writing article in such environment would be as useless as writing 100% test coverage for Christmas campaign microsite.</p>
<p>Thus, motivation to write software article is getting low, even when software is being released. - I call this <em>Know How Sharing Lag</em>.</p>
<h2 id="This-Sounds-like-Legacy-Code">This Sounds like Legacy Code</h2>
<p>Let's say we have application with legacy code. It brings me money and I want to keep it alive and growing as long as possible.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Mm, I should write tests and start refactoring?</p>
<p>Could this be possible to integrate into a blog or website?</p>
<h3 id="Dream-Big">Dream Big</h3>
<p>It would have to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>integrated in blog</strong>, because another external source would deprecate - thanks Statie</li>
<li><strong>composer supported</strong> - thanks Github Pages and Travis</li>
<li><strong>open-source hosted</strong>, so the author won't burn out on yearly fixes - thanks Github Pages</li>
<li><strong>CI supported</strong> - thanks Travis</li>
<li><strong>tested daily</strong> - thanks Travis Cron Jobs (Beta)</li>
</ul>
<p>This idea was created in late 2015 with no solution ahead. I want to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/enumag">Jáchym Toušek</a> for consulting this idea and making <a href="https://github.com/enumag/enumag.cz/commit/3efc82717b9965bb19a2609e4caddc0c5467552d">the first prototype</a>.</p>
<p>And that's why and how <em>tested articles</em> were born.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>How does tested article look like?</strong> <a href="https://github.com/TomasVotruba/tomasvotruba.com/blob/8c68d0fcb64a73fb71f157452288711219501763/packages/blog/tests/Posts/Year2019/SymfonyConsole/HashPasswordCommandTest.php">See <code>HashPasswordCommandTest.php</code></a>. It will last for years, will work on Symfony 4, 5, 6... 42.</p>
<p><strong>Feel free to send one.</strong> We'll make sure it will make it into 2018 and beyond.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
