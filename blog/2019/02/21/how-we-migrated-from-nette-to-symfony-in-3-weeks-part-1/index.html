                    <p>On the break of January/February 2019, we <strong>migrated whole <a href="https://entry.do">Entrydo</a> project from Nette to Symfony</strong>. It was API backend with no templates, but still, it wasn't as easy as I expected.
<br><br>
Many ☕ and 🍺 were drunk during this migration. 0 programmers were too frustrated to give up.
<br>
Yet, you'd laugh if you knew what took us the most time.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>And when I write we and 3 weeks, I mean myself and <a href="https://janmikes.cz">Jan Mikeš</a> and <strong>3 weeks of occasional codding</strong>, not full-time. In total, we <strong>spent around 30-40 hours</strong> each on this migration.</p>
<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2019/nette-to-symfony/nette-to-symfony.png" class="img-thumbnail mt-5">
</div>
<p>How did that happen? One day I met with Honza to cowo-talk. No big topics, you know:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
"..."<br>
"Why don't you try Symfony?"<br>
"I don't have time to play with it. There's already pressure for new features, damn Tom!"<br>
"I'm pretty sure it's easier than you think. Let's give it 1 week and you'll see."
</blockquote>
<p>And that's how it started. In this short series, we'll share our short story about nights without sleep, PHP code and Neon parsing and short-term pain of having no clue what that code does. Maybe even... happy ending?</p>
<h2 id="1-Getting-Ready">1. Getting Ready 🤔</h2>
<p>A year ago we tried to migrate from unmaintained Kdyby and Zenify packages to Contributte and other implementations. And we ended licking our burns.</p>
<p>That's why planning the migration is much more important than the migration itself. You have to talk about resources - <strong>how much energy and time are we both willing to invest</strong>. The problem with migration (or coding in general) is that there is a chance that 80 % will be done in 2 days, but then there is this 1 bug that makes most of the database tests fail. You try and try and fail and fail... and after a week you have depression and after 2 weeks you give up and never go back.</p>
<h2 id="2-Making-a-Commitment">2. Making a Commitment 💍</h2>
<p>Also, we had to <strong>decide to give this a priority</strong>. I was planning to put up new Pehapkari.cz website with training admin and new design and Honza had to deliver the feature. We had a time span of 3 weeks, month top, to do this. Everything else is secondary.</p>
<p>When one sleeps, the other codes. We called each other at 3 AM in the morning to talk about frustration, we shared the joy when one solved the issue. Sometimes we slept for 2 hours, then coded some more because we felt we are very close and this must be the day we finish it. In 20 cases it wasn't, <strong>but we persisted</strong>. We persisted because we decided to.</p>
<p>If one would decide in the middle of a migration to work for a week on another project, the mutual motivation could go to garbage very quickly. No way!</p>
<h2 id="3-Automated-Migration-and-gt-Manual-Changes">3. Automated Migration &gt; Manual Changes 🤖</h2>
<p>The basic idea was to do automated instant migration. Anything manually changes on more than 1 place is a potential future black hole.</p>
<p>We quickly discovered, it's better to use <a href="/blog/2019/02/14/why-config-coding-sucks/">PHP factories over config coding</a> and <a href="/blog/2019/01/24/how-to-kill-parents/">kill all parents we could</a> (except our own ones of course).</p>

<h3 id="Use-Rector-for-PHP-Changes">Use Rector for PHP Changes</h3>
<p>In the start, we run <strong>Rector with generic rules with brute-force way</strong>. Don't think, just try it. That gave us more idea about the code - we started to spot places we can write in Rector rule.</p>
<p>In the end, <a href="https://getrector.org">Rector</a> helped us with many following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Response and Request ✅</li>
<li>Presenter to Controller ✅</li>
<li>RouterFactory to Controller Annotation ✅ - REST Routes and Invocable Controllers included</li>
<li>Kdyby/Events and Contributte/Events to Symfony/EventDispatcher ✅</li>
<li>Kdyby/Doctrine to Doctrine/DoctrineBundle ✅</li>
<li>Kdyby/Events to Symfony/EventDispatcher ✅</li>
<li>Kdyby/Translation to Symfony/Translation ✅</li>
<li>Nette DI methods to Symfony/DependendyInjection ✅</li>
</ul>
<p>The tricky part was to discover differences and create the bridge between both frameworks - <em>&quot;In Nette, you use this, in Symfony you'd use this.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Now it's done</strong>, so you can use them <a href="https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/blob/267989bb05372db937a5e9ece7f2d68cfdec34bf/config/set/nette-to-symfony.php">in <code>NETTE_TO_SYMFONY</code> set</a> Rector set to migrate your code.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We didn't have to change any of these parts, because the code didn't use them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Components to Controllers ❌</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CompilerExtensions to Bundles/CompilerPasses ❌</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Rector can automate them when some project will need them. Maybe your project :)</p>
<h3 id="Non-PHP-Migrations">Non-PHP Migrations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/blog/2019/02/11/introducing-neon-to-yaml-converter/">Neon to YAML</a> ✅ - this package was created for needs of Entrydo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/blog/2018/07/05/how-to-convert-latte-templates-to-twig-in-27-regular-expressions/">Latte to TWIG</a> ✅</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Coding-Standards">Coding Standards</h3>
<p>After many many changes in the code, we didn't care about spaces, tabs or where the <code>{</code> is. That's the job of <a href="https://github.com/symplify/easy-coding-standard">EasyCodingStandard</a>. <strong>We had to focus full attention on code structure</strong>, not to play with style.</p>
<p>Actually, Nette uses tabs and Symfony spaces, so ECS actually helped with migration a lot too.</p>
<h2 id="4-WTFs-Everywhere">4. WTFs Everywhere! 🤦</h2>
<p>This code worked in Nette:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

$this-&gt;translation-&gt;translate('Hi, my name is %name%', [
    'name' =&gt; 'Tom'
]);</code></pre>
<p>In Nette:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">Hy, my name is Tom.</code></pre>
<p>After migration tests started to fail:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">Hy, my name is %Tom%.</code></pre>
<p>Damn! Why it's broken?</p>
<p>In this case, we had to look to the contents of the <code>translate</code> method of the previous service. Kdyby/Translation actually automatically <a href="https://github.com/Kdyby/Translation/blob/6b0721c767a7be7f15b2fb13c529bea8536230aa/src/Translator.php#L172">wraps key name to <code>%</code></a>, while Symfony doesn't:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff"> &lt;?php

 $this-&gt;translation-&gt;translate('Hi, my name is %name%', [
-    'name' =&gt; 'Tom'
+    '%name%' =&gt; 'Tom'
 ]);</code></pre>
<p><strong>Problem solved</strong> in 20 minutes, doh! Now it's part of Rector set, so you can actually forget this paragraph. But be ready for such issues. <strong>The hardest problems are usually behind simple differences</strong> - like extra <code>%</code>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Luckily, Honza is xdebug expert, so he deep dives into the code to find the spots where code failed. It took him some time, but in the end, he <strong>disclosed magic and fixed all the issues we had</strong>. You can read more about that, Doctrine events and HttpRequest as a services migration in the next post.</p>
<h2 id="There-are-no-Happy-Endings">There are no Happy Endings...</h2>
<p>...or are they?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you wonder how the project ended-up?</li>
<li>How many changes the PR has?</li>
<li>When and <em>if</em> will be the migration merged?</li>
</ul>
<p>The project was published in staging for 2 days. The answer to the last question is <em>Happy Valentine</em>. That's the day <strong>the Symfony application was published to production</strong>.</p>
