            <p>I love helping others in a way that helps them grow. In a feedback loop, their growth helps me to grow... recursive. Yet, I rarely touched the financial part. Still, <strong>I wanted to share gratitude with the community, that helps me every day to get where I am now</strong>. I'm very grateful to be part of it.</p>

<ul>
<li>corona stuff, it hit many people very hard, with less work, income, and option to live a decent life</li>
<li>I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/_braindev/status/1276483109165416449">Jamie</a> giving away in June - thank you, Jamie, for inspiration!</li>
<li>accidentally, I listed to an intense podcast with <a href="https://sive.rs">Derek Sivers</a>, that dropped a reference to - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Give-and-Take-Adam-Grant-audiobook/dp/B07F7F8NL5">Give and Take</a> - from the title I assumed it was a book about business and financial matters, but in the end, it gave me more insight how easy and inspiring is to give</li>
</ul>
<p>It <strong>felt right</strong>, so I thought...</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center mt-5 mb-5">
    ...what the hell, let's do it!
</blockquote>
<p>In 5 minutes, around midnight, the tweet was ready. I pushed the &quot;Tweet&quot; button and let message go out in the world and let it live its own story:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'll pay for 5 people to receive an online course/subscription of their choice (each up to $249)<br><br>❤️️ Like this tweet &amp; I will pick 5 winners by Monday 6 PM CET 🚀<br><br>Appreciate a RT to spread the word<br>cc <a href="https://twitter.com/javiereguiluz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@javiereguiluz</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Ocramius?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Ocramius</a><a href="https://twitter.com/matthiasnoback?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@matthiasnoback</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/michellesanver?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@michellesanver</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/enunomaduro?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@enunomaduro</a></p>— Tomas Votruba (@VotrubaT) <a href="https://twitter.com/VotrubaT/status/1284616098202230787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote>

<h2 id="sunday-morning-surprise">Sunday Morning Surprise</h2>
<p><strong>I was excited how this evolves but scared of the feedback</strong>. So I just peeked at the notifications number on Tweetdeck. Only nine reactions? Oh, now, it's dead. I was sad and crushed. Maybe I put something wrong. Maybe I forgot to tweet it, I thought.</p>
<p>So I opened Twitter and looked for comments with feedback, what's wrong. 9 was a count of tweets with <em>some</em> notification, not the total number of notifications.</p>
<p><strong>There were over 50 retweets already</strong>. In a couple of hours, as people start to wake up on Sunday morning, the tweet had over 200 retweets and 600 likes! Oh many, this escalated quickly.</p>
<p>It was much faster and more than I ever imagined, but it was good.</p>
<h2 id="&quot;i-want-to-win,-not-for-myself,-but-for-my-friends&quot;">&quot;I want to Win, Not for myself, But for My Friends&quot;</h2>
<p>I was surprised, how many people wanted to <strong>share their prize with others</strong>:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’ll take the prize and split for 2 friends. Fortunanetly i’m able to purchase what i think i need. It wasnt always like that, and also love to do the same here and there!<br>Thank you Tomas ❤️❤️❤️</p>— João Patrício (@ijpatricio) <a href="https://twitter.com/ijpatricio/status/1284825490369523713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was so touched by reactions that I've decided to raise the limit of 5 to <a href="https://twitter.com/VotrubaT/status/1284616098202230787/retweets/with_comments">9 people</a>.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote class="blockquote">
"I'm mstrYoda_ from twitter. You picked me as one of the winners. As I
told you, I want to give it to another person who needs it."
</blockquote>
<p>I loved that!</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
Please go for it! That's so generous of you. Just send me emails + gift link to courses, and I'll handle it.
<br>
To support your generosity and help your circle, I'm raising the limit to 400 €.
</blockquote>
<p>After a few days and emails, we managed <strong>to give 16 more people a course</strong> on Udemy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="if-you-give,-you-get-more">If You Give, You Get More</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p>I've got so many grateful emails, that my serotonin reserves were empty soon:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
"It is a big help indeed for me, especially in the time of the pandemic. Money matters all the time, and I have a pregnant wife also to sustain all of her needs, and your perks will help me to save money and time."
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote class="blockquote">
Trust this finds you well. Thank you so much for the random act of kindness that you are doing to total strangers like me. I am so grateful.
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote class="blockquote">
I don't know what to say! You do care, and that's a great gesture
</blockquote>

<br></p>
<p>Last but not least, I'd like to <strong>thank everyone who retweeted only to spread the message to their circles and wanted to help others</strong>. In the end, we could help together to 25 people, who would not have this change otherwise. That's a good job done!</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-do-better-next-time">What can I do better Next Time</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many courses <strong>don't allow buying a gift</strong>. You have to contact support and ask if they can configure it in the database to some other email than the one you paid it from. It can be a nightmare, which is not what you want if you want to give away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saying that, pick a <strong>set of courses that have an easy way to buy gifts</strong>: <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a> and <a href="https://laracasts.com/gift-certificates">Laracasts</a> were very helpful. Also, you can configure the invoice easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The two days limit to retweet was too much. It spread too far, and it was pretty hard to pick five winners out of 1 000 people. I'd go with <a href="https://twitter.com/_braindev/status/1276483109165416449">Jamie's strategy with <strong>limit of couple of hours</strong></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="if-you-can-give,-now-its-the-time">If you Can Give, Now it's the Time</h2>
<p>We all live in this world together. Whatever country, DNA, or social status. The world is not in crisis; our humanity is. Now it's the best time to act and do something about it. <strong>Help a neighbor get their food list, buy a friend a beer, buy stranger food, or give whatever you want</strong>. The further unexpected help out of your circles, the better.</p>
<p>I spent some money, but I got much more joy, a feeling of community, and fantastic feedback on this random act of kindness.</p>
<p><strong>Now, it's time to help each other. I thank you in advance!</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Happy giving!</p>
