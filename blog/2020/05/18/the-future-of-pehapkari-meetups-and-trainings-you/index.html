            <h2 id="why-were-pehapkari-born?">Why were Pehapkari born?</h2>
<p>In 2014, the only place to talk about PHP in the Czech Republic, was Nette forum. A place to bring all people of PHP, regardless their framework choice was missing. That's why Pehapkari (first year <em>Symfonisti</em>) were born.</p>
<p>Today, <strong>in 2020</strong> we have <a href="http://pehapkari.slack.com">Pehapkari Slack with 1600+ members</a>, where <strong>you can ask about anything you want. Instantly. Now. In Czech.</strong></p>
<p>Online works on itself, that's great. It took a <a href="https://pehapkari.cz/blog/2016/03/03/kolik-lidi-je-potreba-k-vytvoreni-jedne-komunity">huge effort of 25 people  to get there</a>. But <strong>what about offline</strong>? In 2019 we've organized ~10 meetups and 14 trainings, both in Prague. The rest of meetups is handled by companies themselves, e.g. PeckaDesign and Oxyshop in Brno by or DigitalSolutions in Pardubice.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thank you all for your participation in our meetings over the past 5 years.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>That looks good. The most IT communities could dream of such activity. So what happened?</em></p>
<h2 id="my-priorities-have-changed-in-last-3-years">My Priorities Have changed in Last 3 years</h2>
<p>When I started community in 2015, I worked as part-time programmer to fund it. I got few open-source projects, mostly Czech Republic-related.</p>
<p>Now, 5 years later, I got a bit more on my plate.</p>
<ul>
<li>last 3 years I work on <a href="https://github.com/rectorphp/rector">Rector</a> - PHP community likes and uses it more and more (recently <a href="https://www.drupal.org/blog/accelerating-drupal-9-module-and-theme-readiness-with-automated-patches">Drupal officially announced</a> - it a upgrade tool for 8 → 9) - it takes almost part-time to maintain project on GitHub</li>
<li>contributing to open-source and writing posts takes more time to make it beneficial to world PHP community</li>
<li>I travel abroad to conferences and meetups, that bites off another piece of time and energy cake</li>
<li>also, my main language switched from Czech to English</li>
</ul>
<p>Saying that, I don't have as much time and energy to keep community running, as it needs. I won't be organizing more meetups or trainings, except those pre-contracted.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-want-meetups-and-training-to-continue?">Do you want Meetups and Training to Continue?</h2>
<p><strong>I do, that's why I'm writing this post.</strong></p>
<p>I could continue in <em>stand-by</em> state for another year or two, make meetups now and then. I could say it's due to Corona. But I don't think that's <strong>responsible to the PHP Community, that <a href="https://pehapkari.cz/blog/2016/03/03/kolik-lidi-je-potreba-k-vytvoreni-jedne-komunity">you helped me to build</a></strong> - to you. I've seen few communities to slowly vanish in history, because founders were focused somewhere else, but didn't offer community member to take over.</p>
<p>So I'm offering you to take over my place and continue to grow, where I can't.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Do you want to take over meetups?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Let me know. I'll try to pass you my know-how and give access to website, Twitter and Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do you want to take over training from me?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Same thing, contact me and if we match, it's your direction.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>I hope Czech PHP community strives in online or offline, and we continue to meet each other, find friends and help each other grow, as we did till now.</strong> I really wish that.</p>
