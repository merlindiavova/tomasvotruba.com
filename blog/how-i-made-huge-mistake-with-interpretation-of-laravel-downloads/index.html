            <p>This project had some controversial feedback, mainly because the numbers put some frameworks into a lower position than framework communities expected.</p>
<p>Let's look at 3 main problems.</p>
<h2 id="composer-vs.-not-composer-downloads">Composer vs. Not Composer Downloads</h2>
<p>Most frameworks are accessible via packagist nowadays. If you need it, you use <code>composer require x/y</code>, and the package is there. But not all frameworks that are used in the PHP community have this install model.</p>
<p>One of them is <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/phalcon/cphalcon">phalcon/cphalcon</a>, which is also distributed on packagist but not exclusively. This means unknown X downloads from <code>wget</code>, <code>git clone</code> from the internal repository or zip files. I could leave this package with minimal downloads from packagist, suggesting that nobody uses this framework, or remove it from stats altogether, suggesting similar status.</p>
<p>Both wrong solutions had to be explained in methodology that very few people read based on feedback on Reddit.</p>
<h2 id="how-laravel-adds-to-symfony?">How Laravel adds to Symfony?</h2>
<p>Next problem was that Laravel depends on Symfony with <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/framework">most of the packages</a>. E.g. <code>illuminate/console</code> depends on <code>symfony/console</code> (see <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/illuminate/console">packagist</a>).</p>
<p>10 millions download of the Laravel package probably produces 10 million downloads of Symfony packages. In some cases, even more, because one Laravel package can depend on multiple Symfony packages.</p>
<p>This has to be reflected in negated downloads per each Laravel package to Symfony. But was it good enough?</p>
<h2 id="how-is-laravel-itself-downloaded?">How is Laravel Itself Downloaded?</h2>
<p>Let's get to the</p>
<p>I only had experience from ~10 Laravel projects, so what might be obvious was some was hidden for me. It was not easy to find out why the numbers are so skewed against it, but now I know. I'm sorry about that.</p>
<p>Let's look where I made the mistake in the interpretation:</p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/924196/127477591-8b1550a8-f2f9-41ad-8492-0b16496663f8.png" class="img-thumbnail">
<p><br></p>
<p>In the previous paragraph, I linked <code>illuminate/console</code>. How can you download it?</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">composer require illuminate/console</code></pre>
<p>but also</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">composer require illuminate/framework</code></pre>
<p>The first package has 2.x million downloads, and the second has 24.x million downloads. Yet both will get us <code>illuminate/console</code> content.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="can-you-see-the-problem?">Can You See the Problem?</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>illuminate/framework</code> will give us all Laravel packages but will mark only one download</li>
<li><code>illuminate/console</code> will give us one Laravel package and will mark only 1 download too</li>
</ul>
<p>I assumed that <code>illuminate/framework</code> is not used for downloading packages anymore (data are for the last 12 months), like Symfony, Nette, Doctrine, and Zend developers don't use monorepo for downloads. In ~10 Laravel projects, the dependencies were always used separately, one package by another. But that was not a rule but rather an exception.</p>
<p><strong>Saying that there is no way to find out real per-package downloads numbers for Laravel.</strong> We can only guess, and guess is not good enough to make final assumptions.</p>
<p>Until the most used PHP frameworks use the per-package download approach and use packagist exclusively, these stats cannot be considered representative.</p>
<h2 id="its-not-about-numbers,-its-about-emotions">It's not about Numbers, It's about Emotions</h2>
<p>Last but not least, I've realized using your favorite tool is not about number of other people using it or not using it. The most important is to have fun - so if you're having fun, use whatever you need to keep the fun on.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For these reasons, I'm sunsetting the <a href="https://phpfwtrends.org/">phpfwtrends.org</a> project.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Thank you for constructive feedback and patience till I figure it out.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
