But not everyone has such a passion for technology and yet wants to get the work done with as few mistakes as possible. <strong>Learning a new technology alone is hard.</strong> There is too much edge-case to think about on every level of technology we use.
<br><br>
What if there was someone to pull you through the steep learning curve?</p>

            <p>I believe code automation has been changing the world as we know it. From automated deploys, through coding with CI, to self-repairing systems and GitHub Co-Pilot working for you.</p>
<p>If you work with software, it's worth learning. Do you believe it too, but have <strong>only one spare day to spend on learning</strong>?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>For you and your team, I've prepared 3 practical trainings</strong>. Each focuses on a specific area of automation that helps you automate your daily work:</p>
<h2 id="1-Rector-Ownage">1. Rector Ownage</h2>
<p>Do you want to run Rector on your project and get the most out of it? The first steps with AST are the hardest. This training aims to fast-forward you three months of self-taught know-how in a couple of days.</p>
<h2 id="2-PHPStan-Guru">2. PHPStan Guru</h2>
<p>Do you use PHPStan every day? Would you like to learn to use more rules that would help you find bugs faster?</p>
<h2 id="3-Bulletproof-CI">3. Bulletproof CI</h2>
<p>Would you like to learn from your CI? Would you like to shorten code reviews to fraction and speed up onboarding? Do you want to avoid repeating bugs that are not part of tests?</p>
<p><br></p>

    <em>Rector training with Quentic</em>
</div>
<h2 id="Single-Format">Single Format</h2>
<p>Successful and long-term automation stands on intuitive patterns. To make life easier and transparent for you, every training has:</p>
<ul>
<li>united price</li>
<li>united duration, two half-days</li>
<li>online for the pandemic time being, then anywhere in Europe</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Focused-on-Your-Team">Focused on Your Team</h2>
<p>Why two half-days instead of 1 day? 1 day is easier to plan by the company and easier to sell to business people. It's more cost-effective for the trainer too, when it comes to attention and money.</p>
<p>Yet, the primary purpose of the training <strong>is to pass knowledge to your team and help your team use the knowledge in the long term</strong>. The well-rested brain learns better, and people are having more fun when the training is spread over 2 shorter days.</p>
<p>After the first half day, you still have the energy to try the tool at home after work. Maybe you have <strong>some questions or errors that you need to solve</strong>. Usually, you'd have to google them or ask the trainer after the training via email, waiting for a reply. <strong>That's what second half-day is for - to fill your gaps and make you grow.</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Would you save time wasted on repeated boring work and make tools work for you? <a href="/contact">Let me know</a>.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
