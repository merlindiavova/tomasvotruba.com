            <p>I found first <a href="http://www.whitewashing.de/2015/04/11/monolithic_repositories_with_php_and_composer.html">article about this topic</a> in 2015, when Benjamin Eberlei created a tool called Fiddler. I was using similar approach in that time for a few months and I was happy I'm not alone.</p>
<p>Benjamin wrote about an idea, that is <strong>now integrated in composer by default</strong>. To my surprise, nobody knows about it!
That's similar case for great Composer tools like <a href="https://github.com/hirak/prestissimo">prestissimo</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Soullivaneuh/composer-versions-check">versions-check</a>.</p>
<p>But first, we'll look at current solutions and why I don't see them scalable. We all tried them in Lekarna.cz and learned by painful experience that they don't work.</p>
<h2 id="1-Just-Put-The-Code-to-libs-or-src-Directory">1. Just Put The Code to <code>/libs</code> or <code>/src</code> Directory</h2>
<p>This is most common solution I see. Is there a login logic? Just put the code to <code>/libs/Login</code> or <code>/src/LoginBundle</code>.
Add it to <code>$robotLoader</code> (Nette) or Composer in Symfony and it works.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>it's simple</li>
<li>it's the least you can do</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>still coupled to the application, just now on 2 different places instead of 1</li>
<li>service/route registration is in <code>app</code> - this is cyclic dependency (also known as &quot;vicious circle&quot;)</li>
<li>it shows others that putting code to 2 or 3 places is ok</li>
<li>the &quot;package&quot; is coupled to the application and it's not easy to use somewhere else</li>
<li>dependencies of this &quot;package&quot; are unknown</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It doesn't scale!</strong></p>
<h2 id="2-Create-Private-Packages">2. Create Private Packages</h2>
<p>This way is a bit pro. We used Gitlab and Satis - it took a month to set up all access rights correctly (Gitlab CI and Satis server tend to argue). It's so much pain, there is even <a href="https://packagist.com">official paid service</a> for it.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>all is clean, separated and leads to good practices</li>
<li>all code and test are in separated extension</li>
<li>package have own README.md with documentation, so it's natural to document it</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>development is 4 step hell:
<ul>
<li>add feature to the package</li>
<li>push and tag package</li>
<li>wait</li>
<li>run <code>composer update</code> in application and see the results</li>
</ul></li>
<li>it requires lot of maintainer skills (I would say at least 1 year in open-source) to do it fine</li>
<li>it's premature decoupling that doesn't bring joy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It doesn't scale!</strong></p>
<h2 id="3-Publish-Open-source-Packages">3. Publish Open-source Packages</h2>
<p>I love this most and it was great for some packages. That's how many <a href="https://github.com/Zenify">Zenify</a> Doctrine-related packages were born.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>you feel great for giving back to community</li>
<li>people will help improve the package</li>
<li>open-source packages tend to have longer lifespan than private packages</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>even more steps to hell</li>
<li>it's less flexible in experiments - somebody else is using it</li>
<li>you can't money or security related packages like that</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It doesn't scale.</strong></p>
<p>During this path of packages we started to feel desperate. Nothing was good enough. I was losing my belief in open source packages and packages themselves.</p>
<h2 id="Composer-Saved-my-Life">Composer Saved my Life!</h2>
<p>Not sure why and how, but in composer <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#path">&quot;path&quot; feature</a> was added. <strong>And it was exactly what we looked for!</strong></p>
<p>This is so simple that many people find it hard to believe. Forget private and open-sourced packages. Forget Gitlab, Satis and Github. This is <strong>local filesystem only</strong> solution. <strong>All you need is composer</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Lets-create-First-Local-Package-Filesystem">Lets create First Local Package - Filesystem</h3>
<p>Back to Lekarna.cz. We had application that used own <em>filesystem services</em>. It was registered in <code>app/config/config.neon</code> (Nette app) and it was used in various scenarios. Once we needed to create directory, store image, create image from database, download remote <code>.xml</code> etc. <strong>It was growing and more and more coupled.</strong></p>
<p>People started to create new classes and methods for what was already there, because there was too much code and nobody knew about it.</p>
<p>I had enough!</p>
<p>So I started to decouple this filesystem logic. How?</p>
<h3 id="1-Create-Directory-For-Local-Package">1. Create Directory For Local Package</h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">/packages
    /lekarna
        /filesystem</code></pre>
<h3 id="2-Add-Basic-Package-Directories-and-Files">2. Add Basic Package Directories and Files</h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">/packages
    /lekarna
        /filesystem
            /src
            /tests
            README.md
            composer.json</code></pre>
<h3 id="3-Name-the-Package-in-its-composer-json">3. Name the Package in its <code>composer.json</code></h3>
<p>The file is <code>packages/lekarna/filesystem/composer.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
    "name": "lekarna/filesystem",
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1",
        "nette/utils": "^2.4"
    },
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Lekarna\\Filesystem\\": "src"
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="4-Register-Package-to-Main-composer-json">4. Register Package to Main <code>composer.json</code></h3>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
    "require": {
        "lekarna/filesystem": "@dev"
    },
    "repositories": [
        { "type": "path", "url": "packages/lekarna/filesystem" }
    ]
}</code></pre>
<p>Run</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">composer update</code></pre>
<p>and your package is ready. That's it! Easy, step-by-step maturing and scalable architecture pattern.</p>
