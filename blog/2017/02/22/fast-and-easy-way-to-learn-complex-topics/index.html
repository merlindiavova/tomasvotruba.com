I think it's about time to take it back to <strong>the simplest step</strong> and make learning faster (or machines will). Today I will show you how.</p>

            <h2 id="Philosophy-Everywhere">Philosophy Everywhere</h2>
<p>Do you know <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam&#039;s_razor">Occam's razor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator">Lowest common denominator</a>?</p>
<p>This is the term from their neighborhood. Don't be scared it's of those philosophers. Those are actually mind hack useful in everyday life.</p>
<h2 id="Coaching-example-Create-a-School-and-Destroy-it-With-Coaching">Coaching example: Create a School and Destroy it With Coaching</h2>
<p>When I talked to my coach recently, I realized that <strong>my biggest dream is founding a school</strong>. I immediately started thinking about the building, how much money does it cost, who would be the teachers and who would be the students.</p>
<p>That's not so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART</a>, is it? I got overwhelmed and was unable to produce any real step I could do next day.</p>
<p>The coach got me <strong>from huge and long-life dream to reality of every day life</strong> by these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can you do this year?</li>
<li>What can you do this month?</li>
<li><strong>What can you do this week?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Then it become much more real to me, as I live only 1 day at a time. <strong>I could imagine</strong>, next week I would write a testament on Google Docs, just to put it out. <strong>When you can imagine some concept with your fantasy, you're on the right path</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Same process can be applied to learning and teaching</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Learning-Software-example-Narrow-Nette-Extension-Down-to-one-Line">Learning Software example: Narrow Nette Extension Down to one Line</h2>
<p>Btw, in software, this is also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development">Lean Software Development</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, I applied this approach to article about How to Create Your First Nette Extension.</p>
<h3 id="I-Learned-Extensions-the-Hard-Way">I Learned Extensions the Hard Way</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>By Reading Nette documentation</strong> <a href="https://doc.nette.org/en/di-extensions">that describes over 20 features and uses cases it has</a>. That is information, which is useful, because I can use the tool to it's potential, but not the best adopt the skill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By Reading extension of open-source packages</strong>. They are similar to documentation: many features on various use cases I didn't understand yet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That lead to <strong>overstretching my brain muscle</strong>. It's like trying to jump over huge hole before even walking.</p>
<p>Before starting and article, I tried to find this easiest step.</p>
<h3 id="Could-it-be-simpler">Could it be simpler?</h3>
<p>What is essential purpose of the extension? It registers services to Nette Dependency Injection Container.</p>
<ul>
<li>Register services to Container?</li>
<li>Register services?</li>
<li><strong>Register 1 service</strong> - that's the one and only step we'll make today.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that was the topic I wrote about.</p>
<h2 id="Pause-Bad-Feelings-and-Take-Your-Time-to-Think">Pause Bad Feelings and Take Your Time to Think</h2>
<p>So next time you'll think &quot;gosh, this is so hard, I don't understand it, I'm so slow/lazy/...&quot;, <strong>stop for a moment and carefully look at the problem</strong>. <strong>There might be an easier way.</strong></p>
