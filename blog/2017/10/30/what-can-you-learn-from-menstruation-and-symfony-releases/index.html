As monorepo is use <a href="https://blog.shopsys.com/how-to-maintain-multiple-git-repositories-with-ease-61a5e17152e0">more and more</a>, we should look at it again.

            <p><em>Disclaimer: this post has no intention to put menstruation into any bad light. Exactly the opposite - I admire women and love to learn from them.</em></p>
<h2 id="technical-natural-releases"><del>Technical</del> Natural Releases</h2>
<p>We will look on release management. Non from traditional technical point of view that is already described in <a href="http://semver.org">semantic versioning</a>, <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html">Symfony BC Promise</a> etc., but rather from view of <em>nature</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> When I'm stuck with complicated architectural problem and can't figure it out, I take a break and <strong>go for a walk</strong>. <strong>Just observing world around me</strong>, absorbing inspiration without expectations - <em>serendipity</em>.</p>
<p>To be honest, <strong>many technologies we use originated from the nature</strong>. Processor and hard drives from brain, camera lenses from eyes and design pattern from pattern of nature. What else are falling leaves of tree in autumn? An <strong>event subscriber</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="menstruation-cycle-as-inspiration">Menstruation Cycle as Inspiration</h3>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/menstruation/periods.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>When we look at our main ability to survive - to reproduce ourselves, we see it's very easy to follow. Menstruation comes in cycles of ~28 days. All 4 parts of period have special meaning for the body of woman and her ability to get pregnant. We <strong>know when it happens, how long it takes and when it ends</strong> (roughly).</p>
<p>Now the interesting part: <em>can you imagine software having release cycles in 28 days?</em></p>
<p>Just keep reading.</p>
<h3 id="four-seasons-cycle">Four Seasons Cycle</h3>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/menstruation/seasons.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>A bit longer periodical system in nature that works for some time now. Again, each of 4 parts of this cycle has its meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Spring</em> - growing and getting stronger</li>
<li><em>Summer</em> - reaching the peak and making seeds</li>
<li><em>Autumn</em> - preparing for rest, cleaning up</li>
<li><em>Winter</em> - peaceful time of sleep and retrospective</li>
</ul>
<p>Every part takes 3 months and restarts every 12 month. <strong>You just know when winter comes</strong>.</p>
<p>Now back to the interesting part: <em>could you imagine having release plan synced with the year period?</em></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Also, did you know women that spend lot of time together <strong>tend to sync their menstruation cycle with each other</strong>? We will get back to the later software-wise.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-basic-stone-for-evolution?">What is Basic Stone for Evolution?</h2>
<p>When we look at those patterns of nature, they have one important sign in common. A sign that we can see more and more in software development - <strong>predictability</strong>.</p>
<p>You <strong>know</strong> when the winter comes or when <strong>your spouse needs more attention and care</strong> when her period starts. You can plan, you can prepare and you can learn this by heart. As a result, <strong>you can focus on more dynamic things that are not to predictable</strong> - like your emotions, ideas or <strong>priorities on development of your project</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="symfony-cycle-meets-nature-cycle">Symfony Cycle meets Nature Cycle</h3>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/menstruation/symfony.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>I first realized this at Fabien's talk about Symfony new release cycle on <a href="https://pariscon2015.symfony.com">SymfonyCon Paris 2015</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Major versions every 2 years, minor every 6 months.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So simple yet so amazing. I don't think about &quot;when will the new Symfony come?&quot; any more.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-p-h-p?">What about PHP?</h3>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/menstruation/php.png" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>I recall wondering when PHP 5.5, 5.6 or 7.0 will be out. No more thanks to <strong><a href="https://php.net/supported-versions.php">yearly period beginning of December</a></strong> since PHP 7.0.</p>
<h3 id="menstruation-synchronization">Menstruation Synchronization</h3>
<p>As I wrote earlier, women that spend lot of time together tend to sync their menstruation cycle with each other. Have you noticed that <strong>Symfony matches PHP cycle every 2 years</strong>? Coincidence? I&nbsp;don't think so.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/menstruation/together.png" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>I think they're doing <strong>the right thing</strong> right.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-should-menstruate-together?">Why We Should Menstruate Together?</h2>
<p>We're getting back to software releases and monorepo. (If you see term <em>monorepo</em> first time, read <a href="http://danluu.com/monorepo">this legendary post by <em>danluu</em></a>).</p>
<p>Some people say that big disadvantage of monorepo is that <strong>they have to tag their packages all together</strong> (like Symfony) even if nothing changed in any of them.</p>
<p>I see it as <strong>advantage</strong>, because that systematically leads to release cycle and open possibility to synchronization with other projects, like PHP + Symfony.</p>
<h3 id="see-for-yourself">See for Yourself</h3>
<p>Which of these 3 applications would you pick to maintain and upgrade based on their <code>composer.json</code>?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> with <em>per-package</em> versioning:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
      "require": {
        "symfony/http-foundation": "3.3",
        "symfony/console": "3.1",
        "symfony/dependency-injection": "2.8",
        "symfony/event-dispatcher": "3.2",
        "doctrine/orm": "2.5",
        "doctrine/dbal": "2.3",
        "doctrine/annotations": "1.7",
        "nette/utils": "2.3",
        "nette/finder": "3.0"
      }
}</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>or <strong>B</strong> with <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#name"><em>per-vendor-sync</em></a></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
      "require": {
        "symfony/http-foundation": "3.3",
        "symfony/console": "3.3",
        "symfony/dependency-injection": "3.3",
        "symfony/event-dispatcher": "3.3",
        "doctrine/orm": "2.5",
        "doctrine/dbal": "2.5",
        "doctrine/annotations": "2.5",
        "nette/utils": "3.0",
        "nette/finder": "3.0"
      }
}</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>or <strong>C</strong> that looks like sci-fi:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
      "require": {
        "symfony/http-foundation": "3.3",
        "symfony/console": "3.3",
        "symfony/dependency-injection": "3.3",
        "symfony/event-dispatcher": "3.3",
        "doctrine/orm": "3.3",
        "doctrine/dbal": "3.3",
        "doctrine/annotations": "3.3",
        "nette/utils": "3.3",
        "nette/finder": "3.3"
      }
}</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="advantages-of-synced-vendor-project-b">Advantages of Synced Vendor - project <em>B</em></h3>
<p>Single version for every <code>symfony/*</code> package gives me so much freedom:</p>
<ul>
<li>to update it, I just change 1 version and run <code>composer update</code></li>
<li>they work the best together - I don't have to check if <code>symfony/console</code> 3.3 is or isn't compatible with <code>event-dispatcher</code> 4.0</li>
<li>and <strong>I know when</strong> I can upgrade my application - <strong>the first week in december every 2 years</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantage-of-per-package-versioning-project-a">Disadvantage of Per Package Versioning - project <em>A</em></h3>
<p>And what if every package has it's own destiny?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I'm stressed when</strong> any of my 20 <code>symfony/*</code> dependencies changes</li>
<li>I'm afraid that I will have to Google on Github, what version depend on which</li>
<li><strong>I can't plan any upgrades</strong>, because nobody knows the future</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="call-out-to-package-maintainers">Call Out to Package Maintainers</h2>
<p>All this is not related just to Symfony, Doctrine, Nette or any other big PHP players like Zend, Laravel, CakePHP or Yii.</p>
<p><strong>Every package, every dependency that has own versioning system means increased work PHP developers</strong>. That's stands if you agree with cycles or not. <strong>Version C</strong> being the easiest to upgrade and version <strong>A</strong> being the most difficult and also the most expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Do you want to add extra work</strong> to developer's back to study your vendor release system?</p>
<h3 id="waiting-for-tagging">Waiting for Tagging</h3>
<p>On the other hand a <em>package user</em>, I bet you recall at least one package you <strong>longed to be tagged, but were frustrated not knowing when</strong>. It's quite common that first 3 versions are tagged in within 1 year, but then followed by 1+ year long pause.</p>
<h2 id="syncing-with-symfony-&quot;menstruation&quot;-cycle">Syncing with Symfony &quot;menstruation&quot; cycle</h2>
<p>I like this synchronization, predictability, stability and maturation in our PHP ecosystem. That's why I'm trying to <strong>synchronize with Symfony release cycles</strong>. As from huge to small, as from seasons of year to menstruation, as from PHP to Symfony,</p>
<p>I bet you didn't notice, but with <a href="https://github.com/Symplify">Symplify</a> I try to <strong>release major version to minor of Symfony</strong>. Version 2.0 was released on <a href="https://github.com/symplify/symplify/releases/tag/v2.0.0">July 6th 2017</a>, right after <a href="https://symfony.com/roadmap?version=3.3#checker">Symfony 3.3 release</a> in May.</p>
<p>Being predictable with BC breaks, support for older version and consistent with adding new version.</p>
<h3 id="no-force,-just-inspiration">No Force, Just Inspiration</h3>
<p>Do you maintain a package? What approach do you have on predictability of releases and why? Please, let me know in comments. I always love to hear new ideas.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Happy syncing!</p>
