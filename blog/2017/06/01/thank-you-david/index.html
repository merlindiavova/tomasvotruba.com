I'd like to express <strong>my gratitude and tribute for you, <a href="https://davidgrudl.com/">David</a> - you made my programming life very joyful and curious experience</strong>.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>A great friend of mine <a href="http://honzacerny.com">Honza Černý</a> lend me a book <em><a href="http://austinkleon.com/steal">Steal Like An Artist</a></em> few months ago. I'm very grateful for that, because I don't have much art-people in my social circle. You may think, it's about art (so did I), but it's <strong>more about relationships, sharing, caring, showing your vulnerability and cooperation</strong>. And open-source software!</p>
<p>One of lessons that lead me to this was...</p>
<h2 id="Write-Letters-to-Your-Heroes">Write Letters to Your Heroes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Often when we write fan letters we’re looking for a blessing or an affirmation.
But if you truly love somebody's work, you shouldn't need a response from them.
Write a blog post about someone's work that you admire and link to their site.
Make something and dedicate it to your hero.
Answer a question they've asked, solve a problem for them or improve their work and share it online.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading this, I had my hero in mind, whom I'd like to write. I also shared this though with <a href="https://github.com/JanMikes">Honza Mikeš</a>, who answered me by showing a beautiful thank you email he wrote.</p>
<p>So here is my turn:</p>
<h2 id="Thank-you-David">Thank you David</h2>
<p>I'd like to really thank you for 3 things you gave me.</p>
<h2 id="Thank-You-for-My-Job">Thank You for My Job</h2>
<p>I'm very grateful you've created Nette and you have been taking care of it for the last 10 years. I could work on many interesting web projects, earn a living from it and learn best practise in open-source. I've been maintaining like dozens of packages for a few years and <strong>I could barely remotely imagine, what it takes to maintain one project mostly by yourself. I envy you your huge persistence and determination</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks to you, I could bring together 3 things I love the most in the world - people, open-source and education</strong> - and get to teaching, learning and growing a community. I must say it was a relief, because when I was at university, I felt like I could do only programming or only work with people in psychology field.</p>
<h3 id="It-s-easy-to-be-a-leader-isn-t-it">It's easy to be a leader, isn't it?</h3>
<p><strong>I remember one moment, when I got much more respect for you.</strong> We had a social training group at university, when me and 15 more schoolmates went to a cottage near Brno to experience social dynamics in games. So there was a boat. And every person on this boat had his or her role and I was chosen to be the captain of the boat.</p>
<p>I thought it must be easy to be a captain (or Nette creator), <strong>because you can tell people what to do and you can decide mostly by yourself</strong>. Oh how hard lesson was about to come. We sailed over the sea, sun was shining, we had enough food and I was looking at my shiny boat and life was great.</p>
<p>Later, we had a hole in our boat, we started to run out of food and we saw some sharks around us - everybody was asking me: &quot;Captain, what should we do? Where do we go? Captain? Captain?&quot; <strong>I felt so much pressure and had thousand of issues to solve</strong>. My head was about to explode. Even though it was just a game.</p>
<p>In that exact moment I realized that every time I needed something to be changed or fixed or explained in Nette, I was putting my responsibility to you. My &quot;I don't care, you do it&quot; approach was very one-sided. <strong>And I started to see how freaking difficult it must be to manage website, community, meetups, program a software, do lectures, learn PHP in-depth and invent new revolutionary approaches in PHP.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deep bow to you for all this and I'm sorry for every bad word I spread about your work online or offline. I'd love to take it back, because now I realize it originated from my in-experience with the other side.</strong></p>
<p>Since then, I recommend every programmer to maintain an open-source project for half a year to get similar powerful experience.</p>
<h2 id="Thank-you-for-Joyful-Way-to-Learn-PHP">Thank you for Joyful Way to Learn PHP</h2>
<p>I must say, Nette put a joy to my PHP programming. After all this <code>$_GET</code> and <code>$_POST</code> putting together in 1 file, I could see there is more advanced software that is mostly intuitive and ready to use.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for explaining principals <a href="https://phpfashion.com/co-je-dependency-injection">Dependency Injection in many blog posts</a></strong>. I realized how only this thing helped me a lot while designing apps and understanding other frameworks. After travelling around European conferences and meetups, <strong>I see this pattern is very advanced in our country and miles ahead compared to other frameworks - thanks to you</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Thank-you-for-Showing-me-That-Programming-Can-Be-Fun">Thank you for Showing me That Programming Can Be Fun</h2>
<p>Last but not least, <strong>I really enjoy your talks</strong>. Because they are not usually tech talks - deep, long, boring or complex. <strong>You are very funny and that's what makes you great teacher.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;They best way to learn something is to learn without knowing it.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't know any speaker similar to you who could do such a performance. And also these <a href="https://phpfashion.com/pet-duvodu-upgradovat-na-nette-2-2-3">puns</a> in the <a href="https://phpfashion.com/jak-vyvijet-komfotrneji">posts</a>. Love it :)</p>
<p><strong>I consider master peace to combine entertainment and education in one piece. To teach others by making them feel happy.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe that's the reason I still love Nette and your work, even though I know Symfony on the same level and a bit of Laravel.</p>
<h2 id="To-Sum-Up">To Sum Up</h2>
<p>I just wanted to say a few words to let you know how important you are and how much your work means to me.</p>
<p>No need to reply and enjoy your day!</p>
