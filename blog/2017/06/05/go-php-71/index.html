<h2 id="why-go-right-to-p-h-p-7.1">Why Go Right to PHP 7.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you migrate your project from 5.x to PHP 7.x, <strong>there is no reason not to jump right to 7.1</strong>. You get more features (like <code>void</code> and nullable types), longer security support and with that, <strong>you will have a longer break from another upgrade</strong>. Are you lazy enough to have a year longer break? I am.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Frameworks are migrating</strong>. And let's be honest - huge frameworks are flag ships of evolution. Join them and you won't be left behind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would be easier to develop open-source, if we were able to agree on one recent PHP version to support.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And I think you are already able to come with few more reasons of your own.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-move-hosts?">How to Move Hosts?</h2>
<p>As in every new version of PHP, <strong>most of us still <del>depends on</del> waits for hosts to catch up</strong>. The situation was the same with PHP 5. New software version was already there, but hosts took their time. If there would be some way to move this.</p>
<p><strong>And then, a <a href="https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/go-php-5-go">GoPHP5</a> movement was born, to rapidly speed this up.</strong></p>
<p>Quoting Larry:</p>
<p>&quot;The solution a few people suggested was team work. If all PHP projects stopped supporting PHP 4 and made the jump to PHP 5 at the same time, none of them is penalized in the market for being &quot;first&quot; and web hosts will have a clear business case to upgrade their systems to PHP 5. We can then all start offering faster, cleaner, more powerful, more secure web software.</p>
<p><strong>But how does one get all PHP projects together to agree on something like that? Actually, it's fairly simple. You ask them.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Well said.</p>
<h3 id="go-p-h-p-7.1-as-one">Go PHP 7.1 as One</h3>
<p>I was reading a post about <a href="https://symfony.com/blog/why-will-symfony-2-0-finally-use-php-5-3">Symfony 2 min version bump 5.3</a>.
It was a huge step in PHP development. Even if PHP 5.3 seem like an prehistoric version, many projects still uses that.</p>
<p>We are in same situation with PHP 7.1 now. <strong>If PHP community can cooperate as one, we are able to create brighter future for ourselves</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="when-and-who?-go-p-h-p71.org">When and Who? goPHP71.org</h2>
<p>To better coordinate min version bump, I've created gophp71.org in last 2 evenings.</p>
<p>There you can see <strong>who and when is bumping min version</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-you-help?">How Can You Help?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to express your support for PHP 7.1?</li>
<li>Do you want to help others to coordinate their package development?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you answered YES at least once, add your framework or package</strong>.</p>
<p>Website is <a href="https://github.com/tomasvotruba/goPHP71.org">hosted on Github Pages</a>, so you just <a href="https://github.com/TomasVotruba/gophp71.org/edit/master/index.html">edit <code>index.html</code></a> and send PR.</p>
<h3 id="spread-the-word">Spread the Word</h3>
<p>If you believe in this, share this page so we let hosts know, what we really need. <strong>It's our need to express and responsibility to take.</strong>
We can do it! Thank you.</p>
