                    <p>I used LinkedIn since 2008 when it was sending spam to all my friends. After 8 years of tuning my profile to 95 % score, reading mostly copy-pasted messages,
checking false notifications, flirting with HR girls and hoping for up votes for my recent skills, <strong>I've decided it is time to let it go</strong>. Why and what I'm gonna do now?</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p><em>Disclaimer: even if I get few abroad offers, my experience is related to work environment in the Czech Republic.</em></p>
<p>I was reviewing my 2016 and how <strong>I started to disconnect from social networks</strong> (<a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2015/07/one-year-without-social-media">thanks Steve</a>): I reduced 350 friends on Facebook to 20, unfollowed all but 2 groups and I dropped all people I follow on Twitter.
<strong>My attention got better and I could focus</strong> on things that really matter to me &ndas; reading books, writing and real friends. That's when I started to focus on quality of my environment.</p>
<p>And the LinkedIn account was scratching my mind for a long time.</p>
<p>So I asked myself?</p>
<h2 id="What-is-LinkedIn-Good-for">What is LinkedIn Good for?</h2>
<ul>
<li>It helped me in <strong>first 3 years in paid</strong> PHP programming field.</li>
<li>I got some references and up-votes for my skills, I attended university so I thought <strong>it gives me credibility</strong>.</li>
<li>It gave me <strong>self-confidence when talking about money</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Everybody did it</strong>, so did I (like that time I jumped out of the window ;)).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Where-LinkedIn-Fails">Where LinkedIn Fails</h2>
<h3 id="It-s-kinda-Broken-and-Stuck-Service">It's kinda Broken and Stuck Service</h3>
<p>I was getting fake notifications of new connections. I got over 20 pings for 6 moths old and answered message.
Also, I didn't notice many changes between 2008 and 2016. It could be so much more. Btw, do you remember MySpace?</p>
<h3 id="Irrelevant-Messages-95-Job-Offers-are-Spam">Irrelevant Messages - 95 % Job Offers are Spam</h3>
<p>Only <strong>2 jobs offers end up in real contract</strong> during the whole 8 years. Most of offers are general random messages from bots or people,
who don't even read descriptions like <em>part-time only</em> or <em>Symfony project only</em>.</p>
<h3 id="Target-group-Bias">Target group Bias</h3>
<p><strong>I never look for PHP full-time job</strong>. I wanted part-times only. Not really favorite position on LinkedIn, is it?
Last 2 years I only offered consultancy and lecturing. Well, is that a full-time position?</p>
<h3 id="More-info-sources-more-outdated-info">More info sources = more outdated info</h3>
<p>I put my work information on places like my website, Facebook and LinkedIn. In the begging it's all up-to-date. But in time...</p>
<ul>
<li>on website there is last reference from 2014</li>
<li>on LinkedIn I'm still in university</li>
<li>and on Facebook I just left job I started in 2015</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The more such places I have, the more outdated they will become</strong>. And I'm not alone.
I often see friends who have 3 years empty space on LinkedIn and website, yet still looking for new job.</p>
<h3 id="Skill-Lagging">Skill Lagging</h3>
<p>What can you tell about me from this picture?</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/linked-in/skills.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Skill list">
<p>The oldest skills are upvoted the most. Also short and traditional, like Git. Even if I excel in coaching and open-source,
it looks like I'm 3× better in Git. No, I'm not. <strong>So when I got new skill, it took LinkedIn 3 years to reflect that</strong>. In that time, I'm already somewhere else.</p>
<h2 id="Dying-in-Comfort-Zone">Dying in Comfort Zone</h2>
<p><strong>This is the most important takeaway.</strong></p>
<p><strong>LinkedIn was my comfort zone. It's like being a woman on Tinder</strong>. When I want sex, I have it. And I get many messages and attention from females with not much work.
This backfires.</p>
<p>Having so much attention and job position anytime I want makes me lazy. I don't need to improve. With this state of mind I would not probably reach the dream job as if I would be <strong>proactive</strong>.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/linked-in/allstar.jpg" alt="The Fake Allstar">
<p>Moreover, I've got quite a long profile:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 great jobs</li>
<li>3 startups</li>
<li>3 talks</li>
<li>2 abroad conferences</li>
<li>25 skills</li>
<li>7 recommendations</li>
</ul>
<p>As friend of mine Albert once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Once you stop learning you start dying.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to improve inside <a href="https://zenhabits.net/limits">limits</a> I set. <strong>Now I naturally tend to build something real.</strong></p>
<h2 id="Is-it-Your-Time-to-Let-Go">Is it Your Time to Let Go?</h2>
<p>If you:</p>
<ul>
<li>are on the start of your career,</li>
<li>don't have own website,</li>
<li>don't have 3+ references,</li>
<li>look for full-time job</li>
<li>and don't want to work for yourself but rather for company,</li>
</ul>
<p>I would recommend keeping that profile.</p>
<p>But when you answered <em>NO</em> to all of these, here what you could do:</p>
<h2 id="Be-Proactive-and-ndash-Find-Yourself-better-Job">Be Proactive &ndash; Find Yourself better Job</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build personal brand on good old relationships</strong>.</li>
<li>Talk with people.</li>
<li><strong>Find active social networks where you interact with peers</strong> - for me it is Facebook or our Czech &amp; Slovak PHP Community <a href="http://pehapkari.slack.com">Péhápkaři Slack</a>.</li>
<li>Go to meetup.</li>
</ul>
<p>But this is my story, my personal needs and my personal experience. It probably won't work for everybody. Your experience might be different.</p>
<p>So, what about you?</p>
