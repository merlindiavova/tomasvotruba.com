            <h2 id="what-is-p-h-p-stan">What is PHPStan</h2>
<p><strong>PHPStan is a tool for static analysis of PHP code</strong>. It's open source and free to use.
You can read more about it in this post with very true title - <a href="https://medium.com/@ondrejmirtes/phpstan-2939cd0ad0e3">PHPStan: Find Bugs In Your Code Without Writing Tests!</a></p>

<h2 id="why-i-prefer-it-over-scrutinizer-(and-you-should-too)">Why I Prefer It over Scrutinizer (and You Should Too)</h2>
<h3 id="it-is-open-source">It Is Open-Source</h3>
<p><strong>I can improve it, I can add an issue, I can see its development</strong>. I can't do anything like that with Scrutinizer. It used to be <a href="https://github.com/scrutinizer-ci/scrutinizer">open-source</a> but got closed. That's was a huge step back.</p>
<h3 id="it-focuses-just-on-p-h-p">It Focuses Just on PHP</h3>
<p><strong>It's a PHP tool that checks PHP code.</strong> Scrutinizer, on the other hand, focuses on various languages - Python, Ruby, soon Java and Scala. That's definitely a good direction, but not if a simple <code>composer install</code> command breaks and is not fixed for months.</p>
<h3 id="i-can-control-it">I Can Control It</h3>
<p>I can use it for private packages. I can download it, extend it in various ways (I can define magic behaviour of my classes) and even write my own checks.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-switch-from-scrutinizer-to-p-h-p-stan-in-4-steps">How to Switch from Scrutinizer to PHPStan in 4 Steps</h2>
<h3 id="1.-disable-scrutinizer-code-rating">1. Disable Scrutinizer Code Rating</h3>
<p>Drop this from <code>.scrutinizer.yml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">checks:
    php:
        code_rating: true</code></pre>
<h3 id="2.-add-p-h-p-stan-dependency">2. Add PHPStan Dependency</h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">composer require phpstan/phpstan --dev</code></pre>
<h3 id="3.-setup-command-in-composer.json">3. Setup Command in <code>composer.json</code></h3>
<p>This step is optional and it might seem weird seeing it for the first time, but I like the united usage (on all different projects and environments).</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "scripts": {
        "phpstan": "vendor/bin/phpstan analyse src --level=0"
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now you can run with the same script, even if the settings changes (and it will):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">composer phpstan</code></pre>
<h3 id="4.-setup-you-c-i">4. Setup you CI</h3>
<pre><code class="language-yml"># .travis.yml
script:
    - composer phpstan</code></pre>
<p>Commit and... push! Now you are running PHPStan on your open-source project. Congrats!</p>
<h2 id="the-one-thing-i-love-about-p-h-p-stan">The One Thing I Love About PHPStan</h2>
<p>One last thing. You may have noticed the <code>level</code> option. What's that for? PHPStan has now 6 levels (in time of writing this article) - <strong>0 = least strict, 5 = the most strict</strong>.</p>
<p>This allowed me to <strong>put PHPStan to action without any huge work</strong>. I start with level 0, 12 errors were found and fixed them.</p>
<p>Next week, when I'm rested and full of joy, I can go to level 1, fix another 8 errors.</p>
<p>I love this approach over traditional overwhelming &quot;500 errors found. Fix them all or CI will keep failing.&quot;. That usually leads to removing the tool and to very long fixing process. I remember my long night hours with Scrutinizer just to get from code quality from 6 to 10.</p>
<h3 id="try-it-out...">Try It Out...</h3>
<p>...on your open-source or local projects and let me know how you like it.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
