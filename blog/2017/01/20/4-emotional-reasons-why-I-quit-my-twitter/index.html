                    <p>Nowadays we tend to live busy life with all those social networks, notifications and pings. So busy, we don't have emotional space to just evaluate &quot;How do I like that?&quot;. In my life, this creates cycles, where I keep doing over and over the same thing without any progress.<br><br>After few months feeling bad with Twitter, I've finally decided to quit. Instead of technical point of view <strong>I will focus on my feelings - because that's what matters the most</strong>.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Before I started this article, I read
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2015/11/11/i-quit-twitter-and-my-life-got-better-heres-why-im-going-back">I Quit Twitter And My Life Got Better. Here's Why I'm Going Back</a>. In the article Lauren describes <strong>what was it like to have 1 week without Twitter and why she got back</strong>. If you use Twitter, I recommend you reading it. There are some great insights on autopilot behavior.</p>
<p>Now here is my story...</p>
<p>I felt bad using Twitter last few months. <strong>I wasn't sure</strong> if I really want to quit Twitter.</p>
<h3 id="I-Tried-Small-Experiments-Hoping-To-Get-Better">I Tried Small Experiments Hoping To Get Better</h3>
<ul>
<li>I un-followed people down to zero.</li>
<li>I limited my time there to 10 minutes in the evening.</li>
<li>I tried different approach for Tweets and retweets:
<ul>
<li>pools to engage with followers</li>
<li>retweet the most popular Tweets from the past</li>
<li>mention multiple people</li>
<li>use 5+ hashtags</li>
<li>add 1 to 5 images</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I talked with friends how do they enjoy Twitter.</li>
<li>I requested feedback from marketing expert to my Tweets.</li>
<li>I tried using services to automate like <a href="https://buffer.com">Buffer</a> (thank you <a href="https://www.tomasfejfar.cz">Tomáš Fejfar</a> for the tip) or <a href="https://github.com/search?l=PHP&amp;q=twitter&amp;type=Repositories&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">Twitter API PHP packages</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I really tried, but none of these made me feel significantly better. So last experiment: I quit.</p>
<p><em>Interesting. This is very similar to my approach to crisis in relationships.</em></p>
<p><strong>What were those deal breakers that tear us apart?</strong></p>
<h2 id="1-I-was-Addicted-Give-me-my-Dopamine-Shot">1. I was Addicted - Give me my Dopamine Shot!</h2>
<p>Every like made me happy. <strong>Every retweet made happier three-times</strong>. I only wanted to invest just a little attention, so I refocused on numbers instead of content.
<strong>It's like trying to build a deep connection with somebody having only a 20 minutes a day</strong>. This frustrated me a lot, because I prefer working on content over collecting numbers.</p>
<p>I talked about my addiction with <a href="http://petrvacha.com">Petr Vácha</a> and my intentions to quit, and he <strong>suggested me to use it only once a day</strong>.
I tried it for few days and it was great. I got higher dopamine shots in the end of the day.</p>
<p>The only issue for me was <strong>I had to focus to not to think on Twitter throughout the whole day</strong>. It was like starving the whole day to eat once in the evening.
It worked technically, <strong>but it didn't feel right</strong>. I could spend 5 minutes on 10 social networks and spend less than hour, but I want to enjoy this by heart, not by my inner computer.</p>
<p>I know I can't do something for only 50 %. I either do it close to 100 % or go another way.</p>
<h2 id="2-I-Tried-so-Hard-to-Look-Good">2. I Tried so Hard to Look Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>I planned Tweets for one per day, so I won't spam.</li>
<li>I retweeted Tweets I found interesting.</li>
<li>I've added images, hashtags.</li>
<li>I have read many how-to-tweet articles.</li>
<li>I tweeted only valuable and positive stuffs. Not in relation to reality, really.</li>
</ul>
<p>Few month later I realized <strong>I'm turning into news machine</strong>. So I asked my followers, <a href="https://twitter.com/VotrubaT/status/816753682482085896">how do you use Twitter</a>?</p>
<p>I found there are many news channel that already cover this field.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>I found I have reactive-response syndrome: for every message I have to have an answer</strong>. It's close to <a href="https://zenhabits.net/miss">fear of missing out</a>.</p>
<p>That included conversations under tweets, checking Twitter often for new answers, and trials to explain complex problems and miss-understandings under 140 characters.</p>
<h2 id="3-It-s-Boring">3. It's Boring</h2>
<p>Twitter innovated its service maybe twice since I used it, not much news. Also social adaptions is slow - not many new people are joining Twitter.</p>
<p>I was trying to find fun in service that didn't gave it to me. <strong>It's like seeking a passion in relationship with woman I'm not attracted to.</strong></p>
<p>What I like about Facebook, Github or PHPStorm is that <strong>they evolve and innovate</strong>. Sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't, but <strong>I know they are trying to be better</strong>.</p>
<p>If Twitter was a person, it would be fearful virgin in his 30ties sticking to first job with no girlfriend.</p>
<h2 id="4-I-already-Love-Somebody-Else">4. I already Love Somebody Else</h2>
<p>140 limit for Tweet is fine, but I want to get deeper. I also don't like random Tweet stream: one day 50 tweets, other day 5. What the hell, man? That's so schizophrenic.</p>
<p><strong>I love system, regularity and predictability</strong>. This is the best way to educate constantly in certain speed.</p>
<p>That's why I switched from Tweetdeck-hashtag-group-following based to regular newsletter one in last year.</p>
<p>I started to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://info.jetbrains.com/PHP-Annotated-Subscription.html">PHP Annotated Monthly</a> from JetBrains (PHPStorm guys)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.phpweekly.com">PHP Weekly</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pehapkari.cz/#newsletter">Měsíčník pro Péhápkaře</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.respekt.cz/echo/neco-konci-neco-zacina">Jan Růžička - Týden v Médiích</a> (in the bottom)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.danpink.com/pinkcast">Pink Cast</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And it's much better.</p>
<h2 id="I-Love-Experiments">I Love Experiments</h2>
<p>Leo Babauta happily dropped Twitter in 2013. In <a href="https://zenhabits.net/unline">Simplify the internet</a> he wrotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re going to do Facebook, don’t do other ones too. You can quit Twitter and Instagram. Really you can!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading this first time in December, I felt it's the right thing to do, yet brain was opposing with &quot;that is insane!&quot;.</p>
<p>My great inspiration from polyphasic sleep days Steve Pavlina <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2014/07/social-media-you-got-dumped">got social media dumped hard</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I basically asked myself which scenario seemed best over the next 10 years — going social media-free vs. continuing to use it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Followed by <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2015/07/one-year-without-social-media">a year later reflection</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I love social experiments.</strong> After <a href="https://psychologie.cz/serialy/polyfazicky-spanek">polyphasic sleep</a>, switching main job focus after 8 years, having a baby while being infertile, dropping from university, moving to Prague after settling down in Brno, <a href="/blog/2017/01/05/why-I-deleted-my-linkedin-account/">dropping LinkedIn</a> and moving completely alone for the first time, <strong>I really look forward to this one</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Where-Do-You-Find-Me">Where Do You Find Me?</h3>
<p>See <a href="/contact">contact page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="What-about-Your-Socials-Experiments">What about Your Socials Experiments?</h3>
<p>I've already asked, why and what social networks do you use. Now, I would like to know, <strong>have you made any social network experiment?</strong>
How did it go? Did you like that?</p>
<p>I look forward to your answers!</p>
