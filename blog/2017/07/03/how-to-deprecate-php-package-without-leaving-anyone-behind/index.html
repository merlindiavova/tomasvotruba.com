            <h2 id="Why-Care-About-Deprecation-as-a-Maintainer">Why Care About Deprecation as a Maintainer</h2>
<p>I created over 10 packages for <a href="https://nette.org">Nette</a> in the past under <em>Zenify</em> namespace. I used them in my projects extensively and they were growing in downloads. Then I switched to <a href="https://symfony.com">Symfony</a> and I worked mostly with Symfony projects.</p>
<p>If I tell you this in person, you'd know that future of <em>Zenify</em> is not based on daily usage of it's author and you'd consider switching to concurrent packages.</p>
<p><strong>The thing is: 95 % of users of your package don't know about your personal development and life path. They use <code>composer require vendor/package-name</code> and that's it.</strong> Of course, few people follow issues and PRs around your package and they might notice 6-months gap in activity.</p>
<h3 id="Open-Source-Holidays">Open-Source Holidays</h3>
<p>But in open-source these <em>pauses</em> are normal: you need to finish your work project, focus on boost of another package, you have some personal or family events (wedding, newborn child, break-up, moving to another country etc.), so you take a break.</p>
<p><strong>6-months pause gap and 6-months end-of-development pause look the same. But they are way different.</strong></p>
<p>This is the second case.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.amazon.com/No-More-Mr-Nice-Guy/dp/0762415339">No more Mr. Nice Guy</a> would say:</p>
<h2 id="Don-t-do-Anything-in-Secret">Don't do Anything in Secret</h2>
<h3 id="A-If-you-DON-T-inform-people-they-might">A. If you DON'T inform people, they might:</h3>
<ul>
<li>build new open-source or application that depends <strong>on non-supported package</strong></li>
<li>integrate your package deeply in their architecture</li>
<li><strong>promote bad practice</strong> that you don't support anymore but don't have time to put them in the package</li>
<li><strong>wait in darkness</strong> thinking &quot;Author is on a vacation&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="B-If-you-DO-inform-people-they-will">B. If you DO inform people, they will:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>be informed</strong> - either notified by composer or on your blog (I will your show how later)</li>
<li><strong>know</strong> what part of their application won't be upgraded anymore</li>
<li><strong>be able to plan</strong> next upgrade much better</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Packages-like-Relationships-Stand-on-Trust">Packages like Relationships Stand on Trust</h2>
<p>You have a meeting with a friend on Saturday on his birthday party. During the week you got close with a girl you like and you'd like to spend a weekend with her, because it's great opportunity to get to know her better. But what about your friend?</p>
<p>You can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Wait it out and don't tell him anything. He probably wouldn't even notice.</li>
<li>B. Call him, explain the situation and let him know, you'll come next week as alternative.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What would you choose if you were your friend?</em></p>
<p>Actually, <strong>B builds foundations of great and strong relationship</strong>, because people know they can trust you if anything difficult ever happens between you.</p>
<h2 id="Deprecate-Package-Delete-Package">Deprecate Package !== Delete Package</h2>
<p>I thought when I deprecate package, application who use it as a dependency stops working. This could be <strong>caused by deleting a package</strong>, but not by deprecating it. Imagine <strong>dropping from level 50 to 20</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Deprecating a package</strong> is like <strong>having level 50 and staying there</strong> forever. It will never be worse, but it won't be better either. Deprecation won't break anything and won't improve anything.</p>
<p><a href="https://seld.be/notes/php-versions-stats-2016-2-edition"></p>
<img src="https://seld.be/images/update-reqs.png" class="img-thumbnail">
<p></a></p>
<p>It works the same for releases. When you release version 2.0 that <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/go-php-71/">requires PHP 7.1</a>, it doesn't mean your package won't work on PHP 5.6. Version 1.0 still does.</p>
<h2 id="3-Steps-To-Perform-Safe-Deprecation">3 Steps To Perform Safe Deprecation</h2>
<h3 id="1-Explain-Why">1. Explain Why</h3>
<p>&quot;This package is deprecated&quot; isn't satisfying, is it?</p>
<p>It's common psychological effect that people accept change with <a href="https://startwithwhy.com"><strong>an explanation behind it</strong></a> more than without it.</p>
<h3 id="2-Suggest-Replacement">2. Suggest Replacement</h3>
<p>Software develops all the time. New and better packages are born everyday.
It so much helpful if you suggest a way to go. It doesn't have to share 100 % features of your package. <strong>A package that you'd use if your package won't exist is fine</strong>.</p>
<p>You can combine both <a href="/blog/2016/03/10/autowired-controllers-as-services-for-lazy-people/">like this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since Symfony 3.3 you can use PSR4-based service discovery and registration. It does pretty much the
same thing - registers autowired controllers (and more) - and it has native support in Symfony.</p>
<p>I recommend using it instead!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="3-Inform-People-on-All-Possible-Places-They-can-Meet-Your-Package">3. Inform People on All Possible Places They can Meet Your Package</h3>
<p>How many places are there to get in contact with your package? Programmer A added package to his composer, programmer B read about it on Github, programmer C saw a blog post that your wrote about it.</p>
<p>To make sure there are no deprecation leaks, put a sign on all sources:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Packagist</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Go to your package on Packagist, in my case <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/symplify/symfony-event-dispatcher">symplify/symfony-event-dispatcher</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hit &quot;Abandon&quot; button</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/deprecate/packagist-abandon.png" class="img-thumbnail">
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick a replacement</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/deprecate/packagist-replacement.png" class="img-thumbnail">
</li>
<li>
<p>And confirm</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/deprecate/packagist-abandoned.png" class="img-thumbnail">
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you hope that everybody is going to packagist to check if any of packages they're using are abandoned and seek their replacement... No it's not so painful.</p>
<p>Composer will tell you for every <code>composer require/update</code> that includes this package from now on:</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/deprecate/composer-info.png" class="img-thumbnail">
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Github Repository</strong></p>
<p>The best way to make people know the package is deprecated on Github <strong>is not by a note in <code>README</code></strong>. Nobody reads readme if he doesn't use the package first time. Note in a description is also small to spot.</p>
<p>Much more effective <strong>by changing an organization</strong>.</p>
<p>(And if you still need an access to the package, let me know. I'll add it for you.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Go to your package on Github, in my case <a href="https://github.com/Symplify/SymfonyEventDispatcher">Symplify/SymfonyEventDispatcher</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to <em>Settings</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scroll down to <em>Danger Zone</em> and Pick <em>Transfer</em></p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/deprecate/github-danger-zone.png" class="img-thumbnail">
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill in the package name and <a href="https://github.com/DeprecatedPackages">&quot;DeprecatedPackages&quot; organization</a></p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/deprecate/github-transfer.png" class="img-thumbnail">
</li>
<li>
<p>And you're done!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the most obvious way to let people know on Github.</p>
<p>If this process is too difficult for you, you can <a href="https://github.com/DeprecatedPackages/ControllerAutowire#controller-autowire---deprecated-in-core-of-symfony-33">add a &quot;deprecated&quot; note to README title</a> as well.</p>

<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://f3l1x.io">Milan Šulc</a> for making this beautiful logo that tells all the story.</em></p>
<p>I've come with this organization a year ago, when me and my friends needed to deprecate more package together. As some of you already figured out, it's a place to put all deprecated packages into.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Blog Post(s) about Package</strong></p>
<p>One the most underestimated places is a blog post. I consider it the most important place for people who don't know the package yet, but might start using it. I'd feel bad if people would start using package <strong>after I deprecated them</strong>, instead of reaching out for the replacement right away.</p>
<p>I've <a href="https://github.com/TomasVotruba/tomasvotruba.com/pull/88">created a simple warning system</a> on my blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open post about the package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add warning above the perex with reasoning and suggested replacement:</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/deprecate/blog-deprecate-note.png" class="img-thumbnail">
</li>
<li>
<p>Profit! Thousands of programmer pain-hours saved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What-s-in-it-For-You-as-Maintainer">What's in it For You as Maintainer?</h2>
<p>This all you do is for package users - what a great and altruistic person you are!
<strong>But it has one great upside for you as well.</strong> When I've <a href="/blog/2017/05/29/symplify-packages-deprecations-brought-by-symfony-33/">deprecated 5 of Symplify packages</a> I was sad to lose a legacy, my baby, my work... <strong>But it's worth it!</strong></p>
<p>In following weeks I found:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have <strong>more energy</strong> to work on the rest of packages,</li>
<li>I have <strong>much less responsibility</strong> so I can breathe more lightly,</li>
<li>and I can put more work into less projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to that, I've <a href="/blog/2017/05/03/combine-power-of-php-code-sniffer-and-php-cs-fixer-in-3-lines/">added new features to ECS</a>, released <a href="/blog/2017/06/26/php-object-calisthenics-rules-made-simple-version-3-0-is-out-now/">Object Calisthenics Coding Standard 3.0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ApiGen/ApiGen/releases/tag/v5.0.0-RC2">released ApiGen 5.0-RC2</a>. The last one is secret in progress, so don't tell anybody.</p>
