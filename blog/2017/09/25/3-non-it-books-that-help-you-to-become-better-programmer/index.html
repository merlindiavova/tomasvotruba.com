<h2 id="steal-like-and-artist-by-austing-kleon">Steal Like and Artist by Austing Kleon</h2>
<p>Evolution of art is based on stealing. So is software. <strong>Pattern are replicated through languages and frameworks</strong>. Just imagine how many frameworks are using MVC pattern.</p>
<div class="text-center">

<p>Instead of describing ideas in this master piece, <strong>just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oww7oB9rjgw">see this 11min TedX video</a></strong>. Then you can decide if you like this idea just enough to open first page.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank <a href="http://honzacerny.com">Honza Černý</a> who lend me this book about a year ago and helped me to <strong>build bridge between programming and art</strong>.</p>
<p>Btw, if you read this short book, there also <em>second</em> part: <a href="https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work">Show Your Work</a>.</p>
<h2 id="deep-work-by-cal-newport">Deep Work by Cal Newport</h2>
<h3 id="isnt-it-only-hype?">Isn't it only Hype?</h3>
<p>I heard about this book from <a href="https://tomaskazatel.cz">many</a> <a href="https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/blog/75-hluboka-prace">friends</a> (Czech only) just in the end of 2016. So many at once, that <strong>I was afraid of buy-but-not-read-hype</strong>. That's when <strong>everyone is talking about the book, buying it, but nobody actually read it</strong>.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882"><em>Clean Code</em></a>. It's really great book - well it was the best you could buy in 2008. But now it's obsolete, too verbose, not to the point and difficult to understand by anyone else than Java programmers.</p>
<p>What can you do better?  <strong>You could reach for 80 % shorter and PHP-related <a href="https://leanpub.com/principles-of-package-design">Principles of Package Design</a></strong> or go to fresh <a href="https://github.com/jupeter/clean-code-php"><em>clean-code</em> repository on Github</a> single page <strong>PHP yes/no examples-based</strong> which has over <strong>3625 stars</strong> as of time writing this post. I help to maintain it, but main credits goes to <a href="https://github.com/jupeter">@jupeter</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine peace with combination of 5hour train trips, <a href="/blog/2017/01/20/4-emotional-reasons-why-I-quit-my-twitter/">disabling twitter</a> and other <a href="/blog/2017/01/05/why-I-deleted-my-linkedin-account/">social networks</a> on your mobile and computer and <a href="https://zenhabits.net/unline">cutting of Facebook</a> activity, it is powerful skill-set that will <strong>give you head start before any concurrency you have</strong>.</p>
<p>Again, instead of few bullet points that <strong>got my</strong> opinionated attention, check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk">this 13min youtube video</a>.</p>
<h3 id="protip-skip-the-first-third">Protip - Skip the first third</h3>
<p>The book will then drag you into the stories about 1st class plane trips that produce books over weekend.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://tomaskazatel.cz">Tomáš Kazatel</a> for lending me and <em>selling</em> me this book with this tip.</p>
<h2 id="no-more-mr.-nice-guy-by-dr.-robert-a.-glover">No More Mr. Nice Guy by Dr. Robert A. Glover</h2>
<p>This book is more transformative then 2 before. It's related to family system, partners, about <strong>money you feel you deserve in your job</strong> or about your.</p>
<p>I see many nice-guys among programmers, un-happy with their work, payment, skill level or they spouse and children, thank to <a href="https://pehapkari.cz">organizing PHP meetups</a> in Czech Republic. I could relate to them with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFu5ONiHnMA">my own experience</a> (Czech only).</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/non-it-books/nice.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>This book helped my to take over responsibility for things I'm un-happy with and take the first step to unknown future hidden in fog. Pain worth it!</p>
<p>Here, I'm not aware of any useful youtube video, so <strong>I recommend to start with first chapter and then continue or stop</strong> based on your preferences.</p>
<p>Thanks to all my women and Jakub Lipus for recommendation.</p>
<hr />
<p>And the last take away? <strong>If you want to read some book, let somebody recommend it to you</strong>. Your friend probably know you better then you know the book by the cover :)</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>
