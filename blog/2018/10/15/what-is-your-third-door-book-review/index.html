<p>The <em>Third Door</em> book is actually a story of 18-year Alex, <strong>who chases a dream to interview people like</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bill Gates</li>
<li>Warren Buffet</li>
<li>Steve Wozniak - in this book I finally saw Steve Jobs from another point of view,</li>
<li>Jessica Alba - do you she owns <em>The Honest Company</em>?</li>
<li>Tim Ferris</li>
<li>Steven Spielberg</li>
<li>Larry King</li>
<li>Mark Zuckerberg</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't remember names usually, but I got all these from top of my head - that's how <strong>emotional and tense this book is</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Why">Why?</h2>
<p>He wants to find out, what all these people do differently. What skills got them to the place they are now.
This book is about <strong>hackers' minds</strong>.</p>
<p>And it's not an easy journey, it takes more than 4 years of struggle, pain, childhood traumas, rejections, a friend who turns to great liar but also mentor from heaven, support from family, friends and bigger community of people alike.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    "Reading about Tony Hsieh’s journey—about the leaps of faith he took despite everything that could go wrong—helped me find the courage within myself I didn’t know I had. Reading about his dream fueled me to pursue my own."
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What would you do for 4 years in a row without getting above the profit line?</strong></p>
<h2 id="Emotions-over-Solutions">Emotions over Solutions</h2>
<p>What <strong>I love about this book</strong> is that it's different from all the other self-help porn. It doesn't include:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;10 ways to be more effective you can do right now&quot;</li>
<li>or better &quot;scientist found out, that average person spends 30 minutes a day in the deep-work state, aim for 8 hours to beat your competition&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all <strong>imperatives</strong>, we love to use them, but they barely work.</p>
<p>Do you know what spreads better than thoughts? <strong>Emotions</strong>! The Third Dood book tells the story with wisdom very neatly placed between the lines.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    "A true hustler is always looking for the next one," he said.<br>
    "It's like playing a video game - let's say Mario Bros."
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Single-Honest-Story">Single Honest Story</h2>
<p>I don't want to spoil much, but I'll say one thing: <strong><em>The Third Door</em>  is the most engagement book I've read in 2018</strong>. It sucked me in and let me go in a few weeks. I felt smart, I felt connected to Alex, I cried when... well, you'll see.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    "When I was young, I admired clever people. Now that I am old, I admire kind people."
</blockquote>
<p>Many pop-science-self-help authors like <em>Daniel Pink</em>, <em>Simon Sinek</em> or <em>Cal Newport</em> pop one book after another. Their books are mostly based on research and many small stories and have high quality. They're helpful, but in time it gets boring when you have to think and don't learn much (do you remember school?). In and out.</p>
<p>What I want to say is that I love that <strong>Alex only wrote only this single one book</strong>. It's his life story. Do you connect better to single life's person or to 15 research papers and 50 small stories? And rapport is crucial in learning.</p>
<h2 id="Give-it-a-1-Chapter-Try">Give it a 1-Chapter Try</h2>
<p>It's so hard not to spoil anything when the story was so good. You know like in the <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>, when (spoiler protection), and you wanted to tell everyone?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    "When it's in front of you... make your move."
</blockquote>
<p>So I stop here. If you feel you don't have time to read this book, just reach me in person and I'll tell you more.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But if you want to <strong>become better and more confident hacker</strong> in both life and software, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Third-Door-Uncover-Successful-Launched-ebook/dp/B076NS2JSW">download first chapter</a> for free</strong> and see if it fits you.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>
