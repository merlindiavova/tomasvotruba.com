<p><br></p>
<p>You'll see. But before we dig into code... what are the reasons to write sustainable code and how it looks like?</p>
<h2 id="Why-Should-You-Care-About-Future-Sustainability">Why Should You Care About Future Sustainability</h2>
<p>There are 3 levels of developers by the time-frame focus they work on. Every group has it's advantages and disadvantages. You'll soon see which one you fit in.</p>
<h3 id="1-Developers-who-Code-for-NOW">1. Developers who <strong>Code for NOW</strong></h3>
<p>This project. Single site for 2018 elections. Microsite for new product release in 2019. Include anything that is hype in socials last year.</p>
<p><strong>If the code would be a trash</strong> (literally!), they'd throw everything to 1 bag or maybe right in the city streets or nature. <strong>Someone
else will handle cleaning up the city</strong> #yolo</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/delegator/trash-everywhere.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<h3 id="2-Developers-who-Code-for-next-1-2-YEARS">2. Developers who Code for next 1-2 YEARS</h3>
<p>The project has tests, continuous integration, uses stable packages with 1.0 release. It's startup or a project with profit. The team is fine and slowly growing. It's their first or second project and they try to take good care about it, with experiences they have.</p>
<p>They don't make any mess around the city and <strong>put all trash to 1 trash bin</strong>. Take them out regularly once a week. They're nice to the world. Well, at least at first sight.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/delegator/orbit-junk.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<h3 id="3-Developer-who-Code-for-next-5-10-YEARS-Future-Sustainability">3. Developer who Code for next 5-10 YEARS - Future Sustainability</h3>
<p>...or at least with that mindset in their minds. The code won't probably work with PHP 9.0, but they do their best to make it as easy as possible to do so.</p>
<p>They have great experience with handful of project described in previous group. They already worked on 5 open-source projects <strong>they need to last as long as possible without as little maintenance as possible</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>To the trash again...</strong></p>
<p>It's like recycling plastic bags, glass bottler and papers.</p>
<p>You put effort to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>create space in your home to keep 3 separated trash bins,</li>
<li>explain everyone to use them and split every product to own bin</li>
<li>and when it's full you take these bags out for 5 minutes walk to their destination.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/delegator/manage-it-right.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<p><strong>Though you never see the trash again, you believe it's good for your future self and for your children</strong>, to keep planet clean and away from trash lands. Economists would call it <em>positive externality</em>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now you know <strong>why it's good to separate waste</strong> (= code), let's get to real code.</p>
<h2 id="4-years-in-life-of-New-Web-Application">4 years in life of New Web Application</h2>
<p>Let's have a project that was born in 2015 and see how it slowly grew. It will eventually use all patterns we described in the beginning - except <em>delegator</em>, which is unfortunate for the investors of this project.</p>
<h3 id="2015-Start-with-Controllers">2015 - Start with Controllers</h3>
<p>Project start with few controllers that contain most of logic. It's fast and easy to add new controller with new logic.</p>
<p>By the end of the year there are 50 controllers like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">class ProductController extends Controller
{
    public function allAction()
    {
        $allProducts = $this-&gt;getEntityManager()-&gt;getRepository(Product::class)
            -&gt;fetchAll();

        return new TemplateResponse('all.twig', [
            'allProducts' =&gt; $allProducts
        ]);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Also, it's in the documentation of the framework, so it must be <a href="https://matthiasnoback.nl/2014/10/unnecessary-contrapositions-in-the-new-symfony-best-practices">the best practise</a>.</p>
<p>Little we know, here starts our <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-broken-window-theory">Broken Window Theory</a>, the most underestimated effect from social science in software world.</p>
<h3 id="2016-Add-few-Commands">2016 - Add few Commands</h3>
<p>Application grows and the size needs pre-caching handled by running commands in CRON. So you start using <a href="/blog/2019/08/12/standalone-symfony-console-from-scratch/">Symfony\Console</a>. You get inspired by <code>Controller</code>, because <code>Command</code> looks like it and by the end of year, there are many command like this one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">class CacheProductsCommand extends Command
{
    /**
     * @var EntityManager
     */
    private $entityManager;

    public function __construct(EntityManager $entityManager)
    {
        $this-&gt;entityManager = $entityManager;
    }

    public function execute()
    {
        $allProducts = $this-&gt;entityManager-&gt;getRepository(Product::class)
            -&gt;fetchAll();

        // cache them all
    }
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="2017-Add-just-few-more-EventSubscribers">2017 - Add just few more EventSubscribers</h3>
<p>It's 2017, AI is on hype and you start thinking about product recommendation feature. You use <a href="/blog/2019/08/05/standalone-symfony-event-dispatcher-from-the-scratch/">EventSubscribers</a> that saves many information about user behavior and return best producs just for him.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">class RecommendedProductsEventSubscriber implements EventSubscriber
{
    /**
     * @var EntityManager
     */
    private $entityManager;

    public function __construct(EntityManager $entityManager)
    {
        $this-&gt;entityManager = $entityManager;
    }

    public static function subscribe()
    {
        return ['onPageVisit' =&gt; 'setRecommendedProducts'];
    }

    public function setRecommendedProducts(BehaviorPatternEvent $behaviorPatternEvent)
    {
        $productRepository = $this-&gt;entityManager-&gt;getRepository(Product::class);

        $product = $productRepository-&gt;findBestByBehavior($behaviorPatternEvent-&gt;getBehavior());
        $behaviorPatternEvent-&gt;setRecommendedProducts($product;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>So far so good?</p>

<p>New owner with technical skills comes the the play. And he wants to finally use <code>VueJs</code>, the company is now big enough to use Docker as standards and <strong>there are more programmers that know <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent">Eloquent</a> than <a href="/blog/2017/03/27/why-is-doctrine-dying/">Doctrine</a> in his country</strong>:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Alibaba is catching up and we might lose the position #1 leader on market. Just switch it to Eloquent, so we can hire and on board faster.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Ups! Your code is coupled to the Doctrine and Symfony pretty hard. You're standing in front of important question: <strong>Do you get extra $ 10 000 to refactor the code?</strong></p>
<p>Posing this question, now we finally understand <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-broken-window-theory">Broken Window Theory</a>...</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/delegator/broken-window.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>...because we have personal experience with going it the wrong way. Little to late.</p>
<h2 id="Prevention-over-Experience">Prevention over Experience</h2>
<ul>
<li>What could be done better?</li>
<li>Could you prevent this?</li>
<li><strong>Do you separate your trash or do you wait till your country becomes plastic land?</strong></li>

<p>No. You think for <strong>the future</strong> with prevention!</p>

    "Plan like you will live forever, and then live like there is no tomorrow."
    <footer class="blockquote-footer"> Mahatma Gandhi</footer>
</blockquote>
<p>Same can be applied to your code.</p>
<h3 id="Delegator-Pattern-to-the-Rescue-Prevention">Delegator Pattern to the <del>Rescue</del> Prevention</h3>
<p>This is what we did in <a href="https://www.lekarna.cz">Lekarna.cz</a> - The biggest online drugstore in the Czech Republic. It started on Nette 2.4 and Doctrine 2.5, with <a href="/blog/2017/12/25/composer-local-packages-for-dummies/">monorepo approach</a>.</p>
<p>When a class pattern is marked as <em>delegator</em>, it <strong>can't contain any direct connection to database layer</strong> (Doctrine in this case).</p>
<p>Among most popular delegators belongs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Controller</li>
<li>Command</li>
<li>EventSubscriber</li>
<li>Presenter or Component in <a href="https://nette.org">Nette</a></li>
<li>CommandHandler from <a href="https://ocramius.github.io/ShittyCQRSPresentation">CQRS</a> etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Lekarna, these classes can only use own service to access products - <code>ProductRepository</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">class ProductRepository
{
    public function __construct(EntityManager $entityManager)
    {
        $this-&gt;repository = $entityManager-&gt;getRepository(Product::class);
    }

    public function fetchAll()
    {
        return $this-&gt;repository-&gt;fetchAll();
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>You don't want to check this in code reviews (imagine 5 years doing it), just <a href="/blog/2017/07/17/how-to-write-custom-sniff-for-code-sniffer-3/">write a sniff for that</a> and forget it.</p>
<p>This will remove any database layer reference from all our <code>delegators</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">class CacheProductsCommand extends Command
{
    /**
     * @var ProductRepository
     */
    private $productRepository;

    public function __construct(ProductRepository $productRepository)
    {
        $this-&gt;productRepository = $productRepository;
    }

    public function execute()
    {
        $allProducts = $productRepository-&gt;fetchAll();

        // cache them all
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Do you need to switch database layer? Easy!</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff"> class ProductRepository
 {
-     public function __construct(EntityManager $entityManager)
-     {
-         $this-&gt;repository = $entityManager-&gt;getRepository(Product::class);
-     }
+     public function __construct(Eloquent $eloquent)
+     {
+         $this-&gt;repository = $eloquent-&gt;getRepository(Product::class);
+     }

      public function fetchAll()
      {
          return $this-&gt;repository-&gt;fetchAll();
      }
 }</code></pre>
<p><strong>1 day of work instead of hundreds of hours.</strong> That's what delegator pattern is all about.</p>
<h2 id="Start-with-Best-on-the-Knowledge-Market">Start with Best on the Knowledge Market</h2>
<p>When you start with the best known approach possible, you'll end-up in well grown project that you'll love to contribute more the older it gets.</p>
<p><strong>Just like with children - invest in them right from the start and it will get back to you</strong>!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Happy Children and Project Raising!</p>
