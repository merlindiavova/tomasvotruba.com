I want to write about you, my dear reader and contributor. <strong>I would not make it this far without you in 2018.</strong></p>

            <p>Thank you for discussion under the post - it often leads me to think about the topic in-depth and from different perspectives. Thank you for keeping comments constructive and creative. Thank you for sharing gists to your approach to coding.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you for emoticons under the post, that way I know many of you like gifs and diffs :).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for fixing my typos and contributing to this blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for your comments and votes on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP">Reddit /r/php</a>. It gives me an idea, how skilled developers from countries all over the world see PHP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for the amazing and warm meetups in Berlin, Vienna, and Singapore. I really appreciate the place to sleepover (you know who you are) and passionate discussions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thanks for your feedback that keeps me going</strong>. Thanks to you I could set myself for a goal to write 2 posts a week. I failed a lot in the start. I tried and I failed. But your feedback kept me on track. I saw you're into controversial topics no-one talks about and in short and useful examples of how to code and how not to code. And why! Without you, I would not write 96 posts this year. I've very grateful PHP community is such <a href="https://friendsofphp.org">a big family all over the World</a> and I'm happy you've made me feel welcomed.</p>
<h2 id="You-re-Amazing">You're Amazing</h2>
<p>I'm really amazed by this because the job of a programmer is to find bugs and fix them. We find mistakes, we're biased that way and it reflects in our communication. Well, you - the community around me - prove this wrong almost every day. Programmers are such nice people, <strong>who can appreciate each other and respect each other's work, even if they don't agree with him or her</strong>.</p>
<p>That's very important in relationships to allow growth and staying connected.</p>

<p>I don't share this with you to brag about myself. I write this to show, <strong>how easy is to be nice</strong>. All of these messages made me feel warm.</p>
<p>When was the last time you said something like that to <strong>your colleague</strong>? And when was the last time you said &quot;there's a bug&quot; or &quot;it's wrong&quot;. Maybe similar words that made me happy, would make your colleague happy. Maybe it would reinforce the same behavior to people around him or her. Try it :)</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Thank you again, <strong>you allow me to follow my passion</strong> - that's the best gift I could wish for!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Merry Christmas You All!</p>
