Today, we look on the answer.</p>

            <h2 id="So-Which-PHP-Framework-is-the-Silver-Bullet">So Which PHP Framework is the Silver Bullet?</h2>
<p>According to Wikipedia &quot;the only weapon that is effective against a werewolf, witch, or other monsters&quot;. But also &quot;a direct and effortless solution to a problem.&quot; Spoiler alert: <strong>Silver bullet does not exist.</strong></p>
<p>What does that mean in the software world? Let's say you use framework A. You have many problems - bad documentation, missing package in the core for command bus etc. - with it and you've heard that all of them solves framework B. So you migrate to framework B. Many problems solved. You use it for 2 years and  new problems appear and you've just heard that all of them solves framework C...</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center mt-lg-5 mb-lg-5">
    There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs.
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Sex-for-One-Night-vs-Love-for-The-Lifetime">Sex for One Night vs. Love for The Lifetime</h3>
<p>And that does not apply only framework, I've seen very good programmer moving from PHP to PHP Framework, from PHP to Python, from Python to Javascript... It's a way but has some trade-offs.</p>
<p><strong>If you have a new partner every 2 years, how well do you think you'll get to know them?</strong> Same goes for frameworks (or any field, really).</p>
<h2 id="The-Best-PHP-Framework-based-on-My-Experience">The Best PHP Framework based on My Experience</h2>
<p>So which PHP framework would I recommend to you in 2018? You know from my posts and from founding PHP group &quot;Symfonists&quot; in the Czech Republic in 2016, that <strong>I'm all over the Symfony</strong>. Even though there are <a href="/blog/2017/02/12/drop-all-service-tags-in-your-nette-and-symfony-applications/#get-rid-of-tagging-in-symfony">many</a> <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/26686">things</a> I <a href="/blog/2018/04/23/how-to-slowly-turn-your-symfony-project-to-legacy-with-action-injection/">disagree</a> with.</p>
<p>Luckily, I'm aware of this <em>confirmation bias</em>, so when somebody asks me the question in the title, <strong>I think the right answer is</strong>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center mt-lg-5 mb-lg-5">
    Use what you love. There is no better way to do things.
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, <strong>it can be that simple</strong>. I could give you technical arguments like:</p>
<ul>
<li>drop 3 lines of framework A code and show that in framework B it takes 20 to do the same,</li>
<li>show that framework A can process 35 % more requests than framework B,</li>
<li>show <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorotwell/measuring-code-complexity-64356da605f9">a metric that is 4 times bigger</a> in framework B than in framework A,</li>
<li>argue that this framework has 10 times more plugins, that one has autowiring and that one has not.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that's not really the point - it's not a contest, it's fun. Programming needs to be fun, because:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center mt-lg-5 mb-lg-5">
    If you're not doing a job you want to do for the rest of your life... why are you doing it?
</blockquote>
<h3 id="But-Where-to-Start">But Where to Start?</h3>
<p>Ok, let's say you're looking for your first framework to fall in love with. What is the best place to start?</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="The-one-Thing-I-love-about-Nette">The one Thing I love about Nette</h2>
<img src="https://files.nette.org/git/www/nette-logo-blue.png" width="300">
<p>I really fell in love with Nette mainly because of monthly meetups called <a href="https://www.posobota.cz">Posobota</a>. In English: last Saturday shortened to &quot;LaSaturday&quot;. Maintained for last ~5 years by <a href="https://honzacerny.com">Honza Černý</a> who's keeping an awesome job of running them.</p>
<p>It's a meetup with 50 developers, a <strong>regular</strong> meetup. Regular meetups is the best place <strong>to build deep meaningful relationships</strong>, where you can <strong>learn a massive amount of knowledge</strong> over the years and <strong>to share ideas and get feedback on them</strong>.</p>
<p>This could never happen on conferences, no matter how big.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="The-one-Thing-I-love-about-Laravel">The one Thing I love about Laravel</h2>
<img src="https://www.loadsys.com/wp-content/uploads/laravel_loadsys.png" width="300">
<p>There is <strong>a place where can you learn almost everything about Laravel</strong>. It's called <strong><a href="https://laracasts.com">Laracasts</a></strong>, it's entertaining, it's short (mostly 3-5 mins long videos) and to the point. A very rare combination in software educational sources.</p>
<p>I got into it with free series <a href="https://laracasts.com/series/how-to-be-awesome-in-phpstorm">Be Awesome in PHPStorm</a> series, where <a href="https://github.com/JeffreyWay">Jeffrey Way</a> gave me the best basic about PHPStorm I could dream of. To this day I still use 70 % knowledge I learned there.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="The-one-Thing-I-love-about-Symfony">The one Thing I love about Symfony</h2>
<img src="https://www.rostemespolecne.cz/copohwegoiwhe/uploads/2017/01/symfony_black_02.png" width=300>
<p>What I love the most about Symfony? It has people, education, sharing, the newest information, dopamine-driven reward system... guess!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>It's a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/symfony">StackoverFlow support for Symfony</a>.</strong> I learned a lot of basic know-how there and almost all of the edge-cases. The answers are experienced and right to the point. I just love it. And when I find an outdated answer, I can improve it. That way it's clear, what was the best-proven practice in Symfony 2, in Symfony 3 and is now in Symfony 4 in one page - one example for all <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13901256/how-do-i-read-from-parameters-yml-in-a-controller-in-symfony2">How to get Parameter in Controller</a>. Its like <a href="https://github.com/rectorphp/rector">Rector</a> just to humans.</p>
<h2 id="It-s-all-About-You-Community">It's all About You - Community</h2>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/frameworks/community.jpg">
<p>It might be weird to see that software is all about people. It's about people, emotions, relationships, what people create from their love - a post, a package, a book, a video series, a local meetup, a beer meetup, a shirt with a logo, a hat with a log, stickers, open-source package, conference, a talk...</p>
<p><strong>There would be no frameworks without you - people talking about it on meetups, online forums, people who write about it with passion in comments on Reddit.</strong></p>
<p>So just go out there on a meetup, grab a beer. No pressure, you can stay there just for 30 minutes and then go home - but try to <strong>feel the mood and see how people work in that group</strong>. See how that fits you. That way you'll know you have found the best framework for you, not by some random metrics.</p>
<p>As they say:</p>
