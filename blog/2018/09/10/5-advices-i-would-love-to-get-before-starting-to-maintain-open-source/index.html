<h2 id="1.-be-open-to-change-any-package">1. Be Open to Change any Package</h2>
<p>Everything changes and when it comes to software, it's exponentially faster. How much changed the school system we have nowadays and how much changed content we absorb - mostly through the internet - every day in the last 5 years?</p>
<p>I used Nette for as my favorite framework for many many years. Later I found out what components and packages are and I picked few packages from Nette and few from Symfony for my base stack. One package was the hearth of all my packages - Dependency injection component. Nette\DI with default autowiring was light-years ahead in 2014. But Nette didn't have any new features anymore and the software grew exponentially. Symfony 2.8 came with autowiring. Symfony 3.3 came with <a href="/blog/2017/05/07/how-to-refactor-to-new-dependency-injection-features-in-symfony-3-3/">service autodiscovery</a>.</p>
<h3 id="share-your-doubts">Share Your Doubts</h3>
<p>I loved most of the new features in Symfony and I integrated them as packages to Nette. Since I know their both DI components by the hearth, it was easy for me. But it my lazy-brain stated itching. <strong>Why do I create, maintain and test a code that was already written in another framework?</strong></p>
<p>It was until one afternoon I was happy to share with <a href="https://www.martinhujer.cz">Martin Hujer</a>. I shared my itching and how I love these Symfony DI features and he asked me very simple yet powerful question:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    Why don't you switch that component from Nette to Symfony?
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't know the answer and I promised to make <strong>an experiment that night</strong>. I tried it on Statie and <a href="https://github.com/symplify/symplify/pull/184">this PR was born</a>. I'm still happy when I see this pull-request with <code>+425 −723</code>. The best refactoring is the one where you <strong>leave less code, more readable and with better features</strong>.</p>
<p>The experiment worked and whole Symplify and Rector are now running on Symfony DependencyInjection (+ <a href="https://github.com/symplify/package-builder">few cool additions</a>).</p>
<p><strong>So if there are good reasons to switch, don't let your past preferences hold you back - just switch</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="2.-dont-keep-every-feature-you-have">2. Don't Keep Every feature You Have</h2>
<p>When I started my first open-source PHP packages, called Zenify, I focused to have as many features as possible. I thought it's the way to success - all frameworks did it.</p>
<p>Then I became <a href="https://github.com/apigen/apigen">ApiGen</a> maintainer in 2014. It had over 30 options to configure: file encoding, colors in the command line, coding style check (oh yeah), enable/disable progress bar, check for newer version and many more. First I added more features that were requested and felt great, that the package is growing in its value. <strong>But does eating more and more food make your more healthy? The more feature there was, the more difficult it was to refactoring, to test and to add new features.</strong></p>
<h3 id="find-out-what-you-dont-need">Find Out What You Don't Need</h3>
<p>I investigate Github issues of ApiGen and found out, that many features were implemented after a single request. There was a possibility that only that single person needed it so there are 300 lines of PHP untested code just because the single person wanted a feature for that one run he used ApiGen.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    The amount of code != the value of the code.
</blockquote>
<p>I realized there is a lot of &quot;dead&quot; code just a few people are using. This alone would be ok but dozens of <strong>these &quot;little&quot; features made the core code unable to maintain</strong>, so tool didn't work for 95 % users.</p>
<p>I didn't know which options are used and which are not, so <strong>I did a little experiment</strong>. I made a release candidate version without these options. If the features were really important, some would create an issue - and there were such rare cases. But <a href="https://github.com/ApiGen/ApiGen/releases/tag/v4.0.0">8 in total</a> of these features could be dropped at the spot.</p>
<p><strong>Instead of adding more and more features, you should focus on keeping the main value fit. Take 80/20 rule - drop 20 % of the least used features to make 80 % of those most valuable grow faster.</strong></p>
<h2 id="3.-lock-to-l-t-s,-maintained-dependencies-and-green-p-h-p">3. Lock to LTS, Maintained Dependencies and green PHP</h2>
<p>I thought supporting the oldest version is the best because that's how you get the most users. I supported PHP 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and 7.0. What a wide range of diversity, who cares PHP 5.3 was in End of life, were still people using it so I have to be there for them!</p>
<p>How naive I was :) it only caused me troubles with maintaining and I taught people it's ok to use PHP versions without security fixes.
Now I support PHP 7.1 and 7.2 and it's just a fine amount of PHP versions to maintain.</p>
<p>You don't have to make the same mistakes as me. There are many great examples that work today:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/wiki/Release-Process">Cyclic PHPUnit Release Process</a> - stick to <a href="/blog/2017/10/30/what-can-you-learn-from-menstruation-and-symfony-releases/"><em>menstruation</em> dependency</a></li>
<li><a href="http://php.net/supported-versions.php">PHP.net - Supported Versions</a> - stay green on PHP</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Go through them and suck the gold in.</strong></p>
<p>But this can also backfire. I was so frustrated by maintaining more versions that I could manage, that I bounced to the other extreme - tried to &quot;educate&quot; people to update as early as they can. I tend to lock to the highest Symfony version, no matter if LTS or not. So until just a couple of months ago, Symplify supported only Symfony 4, not Symfony 3.4 today. I had many discussion about that, where I explained reasons like the one above. The last person who finally &quot;broke&quot; me for good was <a href="https://github.com/lchrusciel">Łukasz Chruściel</a> from Sylius when he asked:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    "How difficult would it be to support Symfony 3.4 as well?"
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't know, so I made an experiment. And <a href="https://github.com/symplify/symplify/pull/818/files">this PR was born</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Since then I lock to <a href="https://symfony.com/roadmap#maintained-symfony-branches">Symfony LTS</a>, not higher.</strong></p>
<h2 id="4.-all-you-need-to-maintain-is-1-repository">4. All You Need to Maintain is 1 Repository</h2>
<p>It's very easy to create a PHP package nowadays. It's very easy to create 10 of them. When I started with Zenify, then Symplify, the package-counter could be around 20 for 2 years. I thought that only people who earn living from the open-source project <a href="/blog/2017/06/01/thank-you-david/">David Grudl</a> could maintain such a big number of packages. I had zero income from them, but I wanted them to live, so maintained them... and then I burned out.</p>
<p>After that, I recall I was looking at Symfony repository - many packages but just repository. WTF? It took a few more months to find out, <a href="/cluster/monorepo-from-zero-to-hero/">what monorepo is</a> and understand how it works and how to set it up in very very basic form.</p>
<p>Nowadays there are <strong>projects to guide you</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/cluster/monorepo-from-zero-to-hero/">Monorepo: From Zero to Hero</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/symplify/monorepobuilder">Symplify\MonorepoBuilder</a> for Travis split project</li>
</ul>
<p>...so if you know YAML syntax, how to open a command line and you have a Github account, you also know how to run your own monorepo in 10 minutes even if you see it for the first time.</p>
<p>In that time, Nette went from monorepo to multirepo. I didn't know if that opposite way was the right step for me but I wanted to know. <strong>So I made a small experiment</strong> - a monorepo with 2 packages. It was just awesome. 1 commit to all, instead of duplicated commits in each package.</p>
<p><strong>I never came back.</strong></p>
<h2 id="5.-dont-take-advise-as-granted,-experiment-for-yourself">5. Don't Take Advise as Granted, Experiment for Yourself</h2>
<p><strong>No one knows the answer for your</strong>. The most of these fuckups above were based on the result of the experience of someone else. &quot;If he's doing this and this and he's popular, he's right.&quot; Or maybe he isn't, try it for yourself. Fail fast to learn fast what works best for your own situation.</p>
<p>I wouldn't know how to do it right if I didn't go wrong first.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Happy growing!</p>
