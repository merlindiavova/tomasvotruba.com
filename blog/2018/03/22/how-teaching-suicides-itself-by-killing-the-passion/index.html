What if instead of outside-in - education first, we could do it inside-out - **passion first**?

            <p>This started as reply to the post and I got literally on fire while writing it. Fire I want to share with you. It's not any <a href="/blog/2018/03/19/how-to-criticize-like-a-senior-programmer/">critique</a> to the post, it's the way I see the world.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Hey, thanks for this post. It’s great there is somebody who tries to make it as simple as possible to get into PHP.</p>
<p>I teach or rather mentor PHP for last 5 years on various online forums, PHP meetups, Github and personal lectures. From my own experience, nothing I show is good enough to get inside one’s head, unless it’s his own passion or desire.
For me, the PHP was not about tools, blogs under 5 minutes or the fastest framework. </p>
<h2 id="what-pisses-y-o-u-of?">What Pisses YOU of?</h2>
<p>I had problem, I was pissed, frustrated and angry at something and wanted a change. And everyone has such ONE THING (or maybe more). I wanted to play, to have fun in online game. There were countries, tanks, farms, factories… just game of numbers, but real fun for 14-year old. And wanted to be better, so I count the deffense of my enemies in Excel. Just put their numbers, guessed algorithm from practise and that was it. Iterative IKIGAI.</p>
<p>I think THIS is the spot that teachers, or rather mentors, parents, friends need to find to unlock one’s potential.</p>
<p>Since this SPOT I got to where I’m now, doing the same learning over and over again, just bit further, but not much different.</p>
<p>If in that spot someone would show me PHP and that it’s about websites, blogs or forms, I’d probably go different path, because that was no my problem. It was THEIRS.</p>
<h2 id="i-takes-1-person-to-burst-boost-lifetime-passion">I takes 1 Person to <del>Burst</del> Boost Lifetime Passion</h2>
<p>Luckily, friend of mine only showed me a hosting, where I could put my excel file and then share it with. That was so awesome. And with 15 lines of code, we could share link with numbers of our enemies pre-filled! That was the best thing ever so far in my life and it lead me here to share it again with others...</p>
<p>...<strong>find the inner light in people and just give it a little attention. That's all they need</strong>.</p>
<p>Thanks for your post, it's great to remember my “the Big Bang” :)</p>
<p>And big love and thanks to my peers Lukáš Růžička and Martin Čermák, who gave me exactly what I needed.</p>

<p>What was your THING that got you here to the present you are now in?</p>
