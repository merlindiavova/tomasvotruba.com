<p>Today I'll share my limited experience with parallel <strong>CLI PHP Apps</strong>. It's an experience I got by exploring PHPStan code and hundreds of trials and errors. What is CLI PHP App? <strong>A PHP tools that you run in command line</strong> - ECS, php-cs-fixer, PHP_CodeSniffer, PHPStan, Rector, PHPUnit, Composer etc.</p>
<p>Is all clear? Let's start.</p>
<p><br></p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2021/parallel_dummy.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<h2 id="1-It-s-Simpler-Then-You-Think">1. It's Simpler Then You Think</h2>
<p>I met with parallel in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktfyEKUrabw">a live stream 4 years ago</a>. My first problem with a parallel run was that developers who talked about it made the topic sound very complex. I asked one question to understand one concept better, but in the end, I was even more confused than before I asked.</p>
<p>That made me think:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;parallel run in PHP is something very complicated&quot;</em></li>
<li><em>&quot;it requires dozens of hours of studying, maybe even studying university courses&quot;</em></li>
<li><em>&quot;I need a private paid project that needs this feature, so I have a chance to learn it for a couple of months&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I have good news for you - none of it is true. You just have to be lucky to come around <strong>sources that make you feel smarter</strong>.</p>
<p>The first point is: <strong>it's simpler than you think</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="2-Main-Goal-Faster">2. Main Goal? Faster!</h2>
<p>We don't implement it because it's cool, not because PHP allows it or not because it improves our architecture.</p>
<p><strong>We want to get somewhere significantly faster</strong>. We're talking 10-20x faster.</p>
<h2 id="3-It-s-about-CPU-Threads">3. It's about CPU Threads</h2>
<p>Last year, my laptop got a little shower from wild traveling and decided to stop working. Czech law gives the seller a month to process the warranty, so I had to get a replacement for the next month.</p>
<p>I bought the first Lenovo Thinkpad that looked similar to the one I used, so I don't have to learn a new keyboard for a single month. I got a surprise: <strong>the PHPStan run was cut down to half</strong>.</p>
<p>Why? The parallel run is as x-faster, where x is a number of CPU threads. It's not about CPU cores, but <strong>about CPU threads</strong>. In my temporary laptop, there was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen">AMD Ryzen</a> CPU that had 8 cores but excellent 16 threads.</p>
<p>That means every parallel process based on CPU cores is 16x faster.</p>
<p>Have you waited 2 minutes to finish a command-line process? <strong>Now it's 8 seconds.</strong></p>
<h2 id="4-Look-for-The-Bottle-Neck">4. Look for The Bottle Neck</h2>
<p>Typical ECS command looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">vendor/bin/ecs check src</code></pre>
<p>This command finds all PHP files in the <code>/src</code> directory and runs foreach to check for coding standard violations. Roughly like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$foundFiles = $this-&gt;findFiles(__DIR__ . '/src');

foreach ($foundFiles as $foundFile) {
    $this-&gt;codingStandardApplication-&gt;processFile($foundFile);
}</code></pre>
<p>Before the 2nd file can be processed by coding standard, we have to wait for the 1st file to finish.</p>
<p><strong>This is the bottleneck.</strong></p>
<p>How to start with parallelization? Look for &quot;the main&quot; <code>foreach (...)</code> in your code.</p>
<h2 id="5-Processes-are-on-Their-Own">5. Processes are on Their Own</h2>
<p>What do you do when you need a repository service in your project? We inject it via the constructor and use it. It has access to a database, where are data all up-to-date, and we can load, edit and delete them. We trust the stability.</p>
<p>In parallel, this is a bit different. How?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This point started as a few sentences, but soon grew to its own post with. It's a metaphor that hits the nail on the head.</p>
<p><strong>Go read <a href="/blog/parallel-in-php-for-dummies-cooking-a-family-dinner">Parallel in PHP for Dummies? Cooking a Family Dinner</a></strong> and then come back for the best experience of this list.</p>
<h2 id="6-From-Foreach-to-Command">6. From Foreach to Command</h2>
<p>So now we know the processes run separately, each in its paste. But above we still have foreach. How do we run them separately without waiting for each other?</p>
<p>We refactor services call to another command-line command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff"> foreach ($familyMembers as $key =&gt; $familyMember) {
     $ingredientsChunk = $ingredientsChunks[$key];
-    $foundIngredients[] = $familyMember-&gt;findIngredients($ingredientsChunk);
+    $foundIngredients[] = exec(
+        'vendor/bin/find-ingredient --member $familyMember --chunk $ingredientsChunk
+     );
 }</code></pre>
<p>This way, we create as many subcommands on the background as many family members we have. Each of them runs separately.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How does this work in ECS? Before, we had one command to process all the files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">vendor/bin/ecs check /src</code></pre>
<p>Now the main command is the same, but it runs itself on the background in multiple threads:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># this is what we type
vendor/bin/ecs check /src

# this is what really happens
→    vendor/bin/ecs check-worker --cpu-thread 1 --files /src/first.php /src/second.php
→    vendor/bin/ecs check-worker --cpu-thread 2 --files /src/third.php /src/fourth.php</code></pre>
<p>What is the <code>check-worker</code> command exactly doing? It's the exact copy of the <code>check</code> command.
The <code>check</code> command used to be <code>foreach (...)</code> caller of service, but now it calls standalone processes.</p>
<h2 id="7-It-s-like-Calling-a-Rest-API-Route">7. It's like Calling a Rest API Route</h2>
<p>This step was blowing for me. The typical run of ECS checked files for coding standard violations and printed the errors - all inside on PHP container:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">vendor/bin/ecs check /src

Found 25 errors. Fix them with the "--fix" option.</code></pre>
<p>But how can we work with nested command calls? We do only have bash there, no PHP, no services, no container. <strong>Like when we call external API:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl /app/find-ingredient --member 1 --chunk onion,garlic</code></pre>
<p>Does this remind you of something? What kind of response do we get when we call an API?</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl /app/find-ingredient --member 1 --chunk onion,garlic
{"onion": "found", "garlic": "not_found"}</code></pre>
<p><strong>A JSON!</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So when we call the ECS worker command, we expect the JSON:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">→    vendor/bin/ecs check-worker --cpu-thread 1 --files /src/first.php /src/second.php
{"/src/first.php": {"error_count": 0}, "/src/second.php": {"error_count": 3}}</code></pre>
<p>This step makes sense to the whole previous workflow. It means we only have to return primary data. We cannot return services, value objects or nested arrays, or metadata. <strong>Only return what you need to show the user.</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To give you an idea, in ECS, the result for a single file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">[
    {
        "file_path": "/src/first.php",
        "error_messages": [
            "Use spaces over tabs"
        ],
        "file_diffs": [
            "-$value=1;\n;$value = 1;"
        ]
    }
]</code></pre>
<h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Strings-Value-Objects-to-the-Confidence">Bonus Tip: Strings? Value Objects to the Confidence</h2>
<p>This bonus tip is not limited to parallel, but it's a general lifesaver in an unstable environment.</p>
<p>Seeing arrays and strings above might give you shivers. How can we work with such unreliable data and pass them around our application? I feel you. When I don't have an object in my hand, I feel like I'm naked.</p>
<p>Let's put on pants and use value objects the instant we can:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">final class FileResult implements JsonSerializable
{
    public function __construct(
        private string $filePath,
        private array $errorMessages,
        private array $fileDiffs,
    ) {
    }

    // we'll use this method in worker command to send the JSON result
    public function jsonSerialize(): array
    {
        return [
            'file_path' =&gt; $this-&gt;filePath,
            'error_messages' =&gt; $this-&gt;errorMessages,
            'file_diffs' =&gt; $this-&gt;fileDiffs,
        ];
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>When the worker command returns a string response, we'll turn it into value objects:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">// string
$checkWorkerResult = exec(
    'vendor/bin/ecs check-worker --cpu-thread 1 --files /src/first.php /src/second.php'
);

// json
$checkWorkerJson = Json::decode($checkWorkerResult);

// array of FileResult value objects
$fileResults = [];
foreach ($checkWorkerJson as $fileResultJson) {
    $fileResults[] = new FileResult(
        $fileResultJson['file_path'],
        $fileResultJson['error_messages'],
        $fileResultJson['file_diffs']
    );
}</code></pre>
<p>That's it! Give it time, start slowly and make small pull requests.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
