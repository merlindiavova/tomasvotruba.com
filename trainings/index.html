        <h1>Practical Trainings</h1>

        <p>
            Would you like to learn about Rector, Symfony, Monorepo or PHPStan in a fast and practical way? I organize trainings to pass distilled knowledge from 16 years of experience in couple of days.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the training we code together, learn from mistakes and their understanding. My goal is to <strong>build your confidence to the limit</strong> when you don't need me. You'll be able to build anything from the training yourself.
        </p>

                        <p>Do you want to run Rector on your project and get the most out of it? The first steps with AST are the hardest. This training aims to fast-forward you three months of self-taught know-how in a couple of days.</p>
